      <title>London calling</title>

      <description>Hi everyone, welcome to our next blogging adventure!
In January, we bought one-way tickets to London (departing May 7, 2017). This was a very emotional decision for us. We’d been talking about moving to the U.K. for several years. It was one of those topics that our friends probably got sick of us mentioning. They were probably sceptical about whether we’d ever actually do it. Fair enough too. We weren’t entirely convinced we would either.</description>

      <description>Tuesday was our last day in Thailand. In keeping with our routine, we hunted down yet another cafe. This time it was a small cafe called Ink and Lion. The cafe had a nice clean industrial look, and a cute little cartoon about the owners in the middle of the tables. For lunch we headed off to a Japanese mall. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of Japanese stuff in Thailand. The mall had a lot of Japanese stores.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;.and we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to do with ourselves! So we found the top rated coffee roastery on TripAdvisor and started our day there. TripAdvisor is very handy - we never would have found this place ourselves. It was on a random little street that didn&amp;rsquo;t look like it had much down it!   Jase thought his coffee was good and that it reminded him of his V60 coffee he makes at work.</description>

      <description>This morning started off a bit slowly. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much before 11am. However there was a reason for that (besides last night). Today we were going to the Chatuchak Market, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really open until later. Chatuchak (or Jatujak) Market is the biggest market in Thailand, and one of the largest in the world. This market extends over 27 acres, and has over 15,000 stalls. It is big.</description>

      <description>Good morning :) We were out late last night so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to blog. Yesterday began with an early start to go and watch Mari play netball.  After netball we chilled out and had lunch back at Dad&amp;rsquo;s place. We also tried out their building&amp;rsquo;s pool. The big pool was quite deep, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t touch the bottom without some effort.  After our swim we went to visit Armine&amp;rsquo;s local hairdresser, Tuk.</description>

      <description>This morning we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to do with ourselves. It seems that we&amp;rsquo;ve basically done Bangkok. All of the &amp;ldquo;Top things to to in Bangkok&amp;rdquo; lists are basically the same:
 Visit the golden palace (not really too keen at the moment what with recent events in Thailand) Visit China Town (done) See reclining Buddha (have seen enough Buddhas) Take a river cruise (done) Try street food (most of it looks very unhygienic and smells bad!</description>

      <description>G&amp;rsquo;day. Armine made us a delicious breakfast of pancakes and fruit. Yummy. Thanks Armine!  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have many plans for today so we just decided to do a mall day. But first! Coffee. :) We tried a place called Doilanka.They use local organic beans. We thought the coffee was okay, but we wished they used double shots (the same for many places here). On our way to today&amp;rsquo;s mall we passed another much fancier mall.</description>

      <description>This morning we headed off to Lumphini Park, one of the larger parks in Bangkok.  What is interesting about Lumphini Park is all of the monitor lizards hanging out in and around the lake. The lizards crawl about like mini dinosaurs and have snake-like tongues.  While walking around we could see some crazy Bangkok traffic down below.  Later on in the day it was threatening to rain heavily so we went to the cinema with Mari to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.</description>

      <description>Hi all This morning we stumbled upon a new coffee place called Alto Coffee Roasters. They had a wide variety of flavours on offer such as salted caramel and tiramisu.  After this refreshing pitstop we got on the BTS skytrain, hopping off at Saphan Taksin. We then needed to get a ferry to Memorial Bridge. There were lots of people standing around trying to ask where you wanted to go.</description>

      <description>This morning we woke up a bit later. We dropped Mari off at her school and then went on a walk with Armine. We went to a local cafe and grabbed a cup of coffee.  Continuing onwards, we stopped off at a local bakery we saw for breakfast. This was a fairly posh bakery. We even had a doorman inspect our bags before entering. Inside they had a wide variety of breads and treats.</description>

      <description>Hello all. Today was our last day in Chiang Mai. We were a bit sad to leave as we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed our time here. We also loved our cute guest house.  We went to a place called the Hideout. Jase decided that the flat white was pretty close to Wellington quality. I enjoyed a homemade hawaiian bagel and jase had their signature French toast.    After breakfast, we went to an upmarket spa (we had to book it in advance).</description>

      <description>This morning we did something a bit different and didn&amp;rsquo;t visit Café Arte. Instead we stopped over at Fahtara Coffee for breakfast. We had some gorgeous coconut and mango French toast.  Breakfasted up, we headed over to Kimmie&amp;rsquo;s dad&amp;rsquo;s hotel to await our van to head to Fight of the Gibbon.  Flight of the Gibbon is a huge zip lining tour through the rainforest in Chiang Mai. Over about three hours we swung through the rainforest on cables from one tree to the next.</description>

      <description>Kia ora. A few days ago we booked a day trip to Doi Inathon National Park through our hotel. They had a clear-folder containing tours and trips that they said they could discount. The trip operator was not often named. Usually, we book activities online following extensive research, but this time we decided to try our luck and hope for the best. We were picked up around 8.30am. I noticed that our names were the only ones on his sheet.</description>

      <description>This morning we made sure to only have a small breakfast at our local Cafe Arte. I did however have a &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; coffee. Apparently this is a new style of coffee from Melbourne which is popular here. It tastes like a smaller, stronger, darker flat white. We had the smaller breakfast because today we went off to a full day cooking class at Thai Farm Cooking School.  Coincidentally we also had some Peruvian-American in our group today who were also in our same group at Elephant Nature Park yesterday!</description>

      <description>G&amp;rsquo;day all. It&amp;rsquo;s Kimmie again. Jase will blog tomorrow since we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing an activity that Jase chose and that he wants to blog about. Today we visited the Elephant Nature Park. We chose this activity because of its ethical nature. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a sanctuary for disable/rescued elephants. You don&amp;rsquo;t ride the elephants here and they aren&amp;rsquo;t forced to perform. Usually if you visit the park as a day visitor you are put into groups and you can feed the elephants behind lines on a platform.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone. We spent today exploring Chiang Mai on foot. We walked around the old town square and a trendy neighbourhood called Nimmana. All in all over 8kms of wandering. We quite enjoy exploring new places. :-) Advanced warning: today&amp;rsquo;s blog is more food-focused than usual. Our mellow morning This morning I noticed a lantern on the roof of our hotel (see below). They are scattered all over the place in the wake of yi peng (the festival&amp;rsquo;s last night is tonight).</description>

      <description>This morning we got up early to see if the local bakery was open, since it was closed yesterday. The bakery was again not open, so we visited Je café across the road to wait until opening time (yesterday they told us it opens at 10am, even though the sign clearly had it as opening at 8am). 10am soon rolled around, and the bakery was still firmly closed. Hungry for breakfast and still not trusting any of the Indian-Italian-Thai restaurants, we went to the lowest common denominator: McDonalds.</description>

      <description>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s the last time I listen to weatherman Jason. I was about to pack an umbrella in our daypack today because I like to be prepared. But because it was hot and sunny outside (about 30 degrees) Jase assured me it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t rain and therefore we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it. Hmm&amp;hellip; But before I launch into that, I actually was a bit freaked out this morning because my neck was quite sore after a neck/head massage from yesterday.</description>

      <description>Early this morning we caught the ferry from Phuket to Ao Nang. The trip took a couple of hours, but it was pretty smooth sailing.  The ferry was pretty loud. We were seated inside the hull of the ferry. Luckily it wasn&amp;rsquo;t full, because if it was it would have been very hot and claustrophobic.  When we arrived at the pier it was a bit disorganised and we had to clamber over a couple of boats to get to the wharf.</description>

      <description>Sawasdee. Today was a &amp;ldquo;chill out&amp;rdquo; day. We basically meandered around town and stumbled upon/tried random things. We slept in until about 9am (so amazing) and then went out for a coffee. There are so many café choices here, but today we chose Macchiato house and Cakebox. It was lovely. Nice quality coffee and man, my breakfast was awesome. I ordered a Japanese maple toast dish (the recommend dish). See for yourself below.</description>

      <description>Bright and early today we packed our bags and headed off to our new hotel on the other side of the island, in Phuket Town. Our taxi driver asked us &amp;ldquo;Why you go there? There not beaches in Phuket Town&amp;rdquo;. Yes, but beaches can get a bit boring, and we like cafés. Phuket Town is the largest city in Phuket, although it&amp;rsquo;s not that big. It also has a long history which we could see in the interesting buildings and architecture.</description>

      <description>Hi all. I love a good alliteration, don&amp;rsquo;t you? :) Yesterday at lunchtime we were somewhat impulsive and bought a tour online. I always planned to show Jase Phang Nga Bay, but the weather forecast looked very dire for the rest of this week (thunderstorms were predicted for almost every day). Bad weather does not make for the best outdoor experiences. While I was uncertain about booking a tour (as they were all around 3,200 baht online or in person, or approx $125nzd per person), I still really wanted to go to Phang Nga Bay.</description>

      <description>First thing this morning we headed down to MrCoffee, our favourite little Italian cafe. It&amp;rsquo;s only about a five minute walk, and they have lots of yummy fresh baked goods. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive by Thai standards but is really tasty. Kimmie ordered a fresh mango.  After breakfast we headed back down to the same massage place we went to yesterday. Kimmie order an aromatherapy massage meanwhile I opted for the Thai massage.</description>

      <description>Sa-was-dee kap (hello) Last night we arrived at our little resort in Karon beach pretty tired and ready to sleep. I was quite relieved that we managed to reach our destination without any real issues (although it was not stress-free, e.g. figuring out the taxi system at Phuket airport). I get the feeling that a lot of the time in Thailand it&amp;rsquo;s a case of &amp;ldquo;try and hope for the best&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It turns out that the morning of the 6th of November is not a good morning to get up early. We had a 3am start, but were kept awake most of the night by fireworks! You might recall that on our Japan trip we took one bag between us. We tried to also pack light for this trip (Kimmie is becoming masterful at this :) ). Our bags totalled less than 10kg!</description>

      <description>Kia ora everyone. Thanks for joining us again.  It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since we posted our final thoughts on our Japan trip. This year we&amp;rsquo;re travelling to Thailand for about 3 weeks. We&amp;rsquo;ve been planning this holiday for over 6 months, and now it&amp;rsquo;s less than 6 days until we leave! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe when your holiday is this close. Suddenly, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a far away two-hour-Thai-aromatherapy-massage daydream.</description>

      <description>The good:
 Japan was actually surprisingly green. In the cities, only the flat land is built on, and the hills are left for forest reserves. When you get outside of the cities, the countryside is mostly hilly forests, with the occasional cute traditional town and rice paddies. The Shinkansen trains were pretty amazing. Far more comfortable, and way less hassle than flying. The rides were really smooth too. At one point in Kyoto the train to Osaka was three minutes late, and we had somebody come out onto the platform to apologise to us.</description>

      <description>Today we only had a short amount of time to explore because our flight back home was at 8.30pm (and working backwards from there we only had free time until about 3pm). We decided to check out Odaiba, a man-made island that is known for its futuristic style. We had to catch 2 trains to get there, which took about 30mins in total. The view going across to Odaiba from the mainland was quite awesome.</description>

      <description>As some of you may know, Kimmie is a bit of a roller coaster nut. Japan has some pretty crazy roller coasters but we haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to fit any into our schedule. So to appease her, this morning we went over to the Tokyo Dome. Tokyo Dome is Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s main baseball stadium in the middle of Tokyo. Baseball is the most popular sport in Japan, and every city has its own team.</description>

      <description>Aloha! After eating the complementary breakfast provided at our hotel we headed off to Shinjuku. Shinjuku is full of tall buildings with lots of signs and lights. There were big screen adverts an people trying to sell you things.   So many noises and funky smells. I felt that I my senses were being constantly assaulted. One of the first things we did today was try a coffee from a cafe set up by an Australian.</description>

      <description>We made it to the station this morning in good time. We arrived just after one Shinkansen left, so we were first in line for the next one. It was already pretty full when we hopped on, but we managed to get a couple of seats next to one another. After each station more people got on. By the time we reached Tokyo there were quite a few people standing, and they had been for well over an hour!</description>

      <description>Jase has been looking forward to today, because he was excited to see monkeys. Today was monkey mountain day. We caught a local train from Kyoto to Saga-Arashiyama Station. It was a lovely day and many people were taking advantage of it by hiring bikes. The first thing we did was to check out the bamboo grove. It&amp;rsquo;s nice and shady under the tall bambo. We enjoyed a nice stroll surrounded by bamboo.</description>

      <description>We made good time this morning getting up and hopping on the train. This time we went to Inari station, which is next to the famous Fushimi Inari shrine. Fushimi Inari shrine is a shrine dedicated to wealth, prosperity, and a good harvest. One of the key symbols is the fox, and there were many fox statues around the shrine.  What makes this shrine so famous are the 10,000+ Torii gates which line the path up to the top of Mount Inari.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have much planned for today. The weather was a bit drizzly, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t great for the outdoor activities we&amp;rsquo;d like to do. Instead Kimmie found the address of a local cat cafe online. After a bit of a hike, we made it to the cafe. One oddity about Japan is that many stores, cafes, restaurants etc are stuck a couple of stories up a nondescript building. To access them you generally need to use a skungy old elevator with carpet on the wall.</description>

      <description>Konichiwa! It&amp;rsquo;s me again (Kimmie), because I wanted to describe my maiko experience in more detail than Jase could. So he&amp;rsquo;ll blog the next two days. This morning we braved the public transport to get to my appointment at the maiko makeover place near Gion. I was nervous about being late and not being able to find the place. Luckily we found it with the help of google maps! I was expecting the place to be full of girls wanting to be made up, but at 10am I was one of only two.</description>

      <description>Konichiwa! We left Miyajima this morning with stiff leg muscles after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s climb, but not before trying another local coffee place. This one was actually quite good. They even drew cool designs on the froth.  We observed that good coffee is more expensive in Japan compared to back home, at around $5-$6 a coffee. Jase got a photo from the ferry. You can see the Torii in the distance.  We caught a local train and then a Shinkansen to get to Kyoto.</description>

      <description>We started off today with a trip to the local coffee shop. The sun was shining and it was already getting hot, so we opted for the ubiquitous iced coffee. They&amp;rsquo;re far more popular here than back home. Once we were caffeinated up, we hit the trail to start our ascent of Mount Misen. Mount Misen is the tallest peak on Miyajima. At 535m, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty high (For reference, that&amp;rsquo;s about the same height as Kapiti Island&amp;rsquo;s summit).</description>

      <description>Konbanwa (good evening)! This morning we tried to do laundry before heading off to our next destination, Miyajima. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best way to start the day. After our clothes came out of the dryer they weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly dry (annoying since we had to pay for these facilities). Unfortunately as well, we had to check out of our hotel. So we ended up packing the damp clothes into a plastic bag (later we paid to use a better drier at our accommodation in Miyajima).</description>

      <description>Today started with a rush for the train. There were no more reserved seats available on the JR Thunderbird, so we had to wait in line for the first in, first served unreserved seats. Luckily we managed to grab some! After passing through some tunnels we came out on the other side of the island. We sped past Kyoto which was hot and sunny. Hopefully the weather will still be like that when we visit in a week&amp;rsquo;s time.</description>

      <description>Konichiwa! We woke up this morning expecting better weather than yesterday because of the weather forecast predictions. I don&amp;rsquo;t really trust weather forecasts, and I feel justified in my doubting ways after today&amp;rsquo;s weather! It rained on and off all day. Luckily whenever the weather cleared we dried off quickly (we got wet despite the umbrella) due to the warm air. A forewarning: as a result of the weather, today basically became a food and drink sampling day.</description>

      <description>So today started out much like any other day: with convenience store onigiri (filled rice triangles wrapped in seaweed). It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good cheap, filling breakfast. Kimmie had gyoza. The combini of Japan are much more convenient that the dairies back home. For a start the combini are fairly cheap, but they&amp;rsquo;re also everywhere. At times literally every street block has at least one combini. They have a pretty good range.</description>

      <description>Konochiwa. 😊 We again slept well, but as I like to sleep on the edge of pillows, I found the tatami pillow (which was firm and wavey) a bit uncomfortable. Jase did not have any worries. This morning we had to check out of our ryokan. Before doing so, we ate our final ryokan breakfast. Once again we had 12 little dishes to devour. I definitely had my favourites, and tried to save the best for last.</description>

      <description>The Onsen at this place are awesome. I swear I&amp;rsquo;ve had more baths in the past two days than I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past two years. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been having two soaks a day. They&amp;rsquo;re public baths, but they&amp;rsquo;re pretty hygienic. You have to completely shower and clean yourself before getting in. Everybody is naked in the baths, which takes a bit of getting used to. However when we&amp;rsquo;ve been we&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much been the only ones there.</description>

      <description>Ohayō gozaimas (good morning)! We got going at 6.30am this morning because we needed to get the train from Ueno to Tokyo in order to then catch our Shinkansen (bullet train). The morning started off a bit stressful because somehow we got a bit lost around Ueno station, and then even more lost when we were at Tokyo station! At Tokyo station we needed to hand in our &amp;ldquo;exchange order&amp;rdquo; to receive and activate our Japan Rail (JR) pass.</description>

      <description>So today started out much like yesterday: with onigiri. You can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with $1.50 rice triangles. We took off to Shibuya. It&amp;rsquo;s at the opposite side of the main Yamanote railway loop. So took about half an hour. The ride was still only about $2.50. The trains are pretty reasonable here. We took the typical touristy pictures next to the hachiko statue and at the crossing.  Hachiko was a loyal dog who waited at the station every day for his master, even after the master passed away.</description>

      <description>Konichiwa! I tried to post this last night but everything froze on me. I think I overloaded the blog with pics&amp;hellip; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We slept well after our long flight yesterday. However, that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean we slept in! We were keen to get out and explore even though most shops don&amp;rsquo;t open until 10am. Instead of shopping we started the day at a nearby coffee store, grabbed some breakfast at a local Family Mart, and then went for a stroll around Ueno park.</description>

      <description>So the day started early. We checked out of the Ibis at 4am. We never saw the hotel in the daylight.  Our plane was the second one of the day. Conveniently Auckland has KFC at the airport. How convenient? Popcorn chicken for brekky it was. The first flight was pretty uneventful. I was hoping the Gold Coast airport would have another KFC so I could take a bucket on the next plane for lunch.</description>

      <description>After work today we got home and did a few last minute things. I was fairly relaxed but Jase was encouraging me to hurry along (strange, usually it&amp;rsquo;s the other way around?). We then went out to grab some food. I was originally thinking Burger Fuel but Jase was worried that would take too long. So we got Tommy Millions pizza slices instead. All this rushing only to get to the airport with quite a lot of time to spare.</description>

You know, we had a hard time thinking of a name for our blog. We went through all sorts of weird names: chocolatesushi, sushimagic, mangosushi&amp;hellip;. (Jase has sushi on the brain) Then Jase decided that we should combine two words that start with the first letter of our names. He came up with jovial. I could not think of a cool k word. I do like dragons though.</description>

Throughout the day we had a stream of people leaving and lots of goodbyes. I went out for a bit of shopping with Tara and Sophia, just so that I could say I did something.</description>

  An elephant outside the club   The club was lush. There was a large indoors section, and then a really nice garden area. Mack bought us champagne and vodka. The drinks cost about the same as drinks in Wellington, which by Indian standards is exorbitant.</description>

We had a fairly long tuktuk ride and then we met a local guide at the Chinese Buddhism shrine.
From there he showed us around the main shrine where we saw the Buddha tree and the golden Buddha. We then went next door to the stump I think it was called. This is a giant concrete mound which was created to commemorate the location.</description>

      <description>The day before yesterday we caught a sleeper train. It was 13 hours from Agra to Varanasi. We had to get locks and chains for our bags on this one because apparently baggage thefts happen. Apparently the theives throw your luggage off the train for their accomplices to pick up. The ride itself was fairly uneventful. I slept listening to music.
Our new hotel in Varanasi is nice. It seems to be the only nice thing in the city though.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we took the bus from Pushkar to Jaipur. We had the option of taking a public bus for 6 hours, or paying an extra 150 rupee for a quicker private bus. We opted for the private one.
The girls bought booze for the bus and so got pretty rowdy over the journey. At one point on the bus we saw a mini sand tornado form on the side of the road.</description>

      <description>We got up again at 5am to climb a local hill and watch the sunrise. It was pretty tall and there were lots of steps.
Up the top there was a bunch of hippies smoking weed and dancing to electronic music.
There was a temple up the top, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother going inside. Behind the temple there were lots of rocks which we climbed to watch the sunrise.
  The sunrise next to the temple   Ricky called over a troop of monkeys and then it was all on!</description>

Afterwards we went on a boat ride on the lake. We circled the lake palace, and saw the place which the Taj Mahal was modeled after. Apparently you can hire out the island for weddings. It costs around $150k. Angelina Jolie an Brad Pitt got married there.</description>

      <description>At 5am we caught the public bus to Jodhpur. The bus ride was alright, except for the horn on the bus. They used it frequently, and there were about half a dozen different sounds, each more ridiculous than the last. There didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a pattern determining their usage. Nobody got much sleep.
  The tower in Jodhpur   We arrived at the polo heritage hotel. This place is really nice.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we arrived in Jaisalmer. It&amp;rsquo;s hot here. Luckily the hotel has a pool we can dip our feet in.
We went on an initial orientation walk, and then visited the lake. The girls went on a boat ride while we stayed on the shore. It was really peaceful. I met a guy called Saword who was an airforce engineer. He was really interested about NZ. His wife was there too, hurrying him up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we went to visit the fort at Bikaner. It&amp;rsquo;d been built up over many years by many different Raj so there was a huge amount of variation in the architecture.
We saw the royal bedroom. The bed was deliberately low to the ground so that enemies couldn&amp;rsquo;t hide under it.
  One of the grand rooms   Many of the rooms were fantastically painted. The old raj really liked their art.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we left the hotel in these small mini vans. I was seated at the back. No seatbelts, no windows. Ricky put on some pumping Bollywood music so we were singing and dancing on our ride through the streets.
  Sitting in the back of the van   The Indian roads are interesting. There are two road rules:
 Drive on the left. Give way to cows.  The first isn&amp;rsquo;t strictly adhered to.</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening we went out to another restaurant recommended by Ricky, our guide. It turned out to be a bit of a case of déjà Vu. The menu was identical to that which we went to the night previously. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that the two places are just for tourists. You&amp;rsquo;d never expect to see butter chicken on the menu of a real Indian restaurant.
I ended up ordering a biryani with a long name.</description>

      <description>Today we got up bright and early for a day trip around Delhi.
We took the metro which was very busy. It&amp;rsquo;s was kinda funny how the front carriage was always reserved for women.
We travelled around some of the oldest streets in Delhi to get to the largest mosque in Asia. Jama Masjid was the name. It was pretty impressive.
  Jama Masjid mosque   Then we went to a Shik temple where they had a book which they fed, sang to, and put to bed at night.</description>

      <description>So, I made it to the joining hotel. Somehow.
You know how I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of warnings never to drink the water in India? What was this first thing I did when I arrived? I made beeline for the nearest drinking fountain and took a sip. Whoops. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be ok.
After half an hour with some immigration officials who resembled the two Ronnies I managed to get my entry visa.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve now met the rest of my group. There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mix. Lots of people from the UK. We decided to go on a bit of an adventure outside.
  The city outside   Lots of dust. So much dust. My eyes were watering. Also lots of stalls, all mostly selling the same stuff. Finally there were lots of beggars and sales people. If you say &amp;ldquo;No thank you&amp;rdquo; they keep pestering you.</description>

      <description>Forgot to mention in the previous post that Air New Zealand ID&amp;rsquo;d me for alcohol on the flight. Must be my baby face. It&amp;rsquo;s a real pain digging around for you passport while your tray table is full.
Before boarding the flight I was paged by the ground crew and quizzed over my visa. I thought I was late for the flight and ended up chucking out my yummy pasta salad which made up dinner #2 :-/</description>

      <description>Some pretty cool views of the Makara wind turbines on my way over.
  The view leaving Wellington   It was a pretty good flight. The food was decent. I ended up watching the movie Gravity because I felt like watching a disaster movie about flying above the earth while I was flying above the earth.
Best part was the landing. There was a gull with its wings up saying &amp;ldquo;come at me bro&amp;rdquo; to the plane.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently hanging out at the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; departure lounge (Burger King) waiting for my flight. Too bad I left all of my change at home. Otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d be able to play Metallica pinball while I wait.
  The best place to wait   It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful Wellington day to be flying out on.</description>

      <description>Blogs. They&amp;rsquo;re the in thing these days. Nuff said. With any luck this blog will be a vehicle to chronicle my adventures and whatever happens in between. Or I&amp;rsquo;ll get lazy and the last thing you&amp;rsquo;ll know is I am lost in a jungle. Never to be heard from again. Lately I&amp;rsquo;m been doing much planning for my upcoming trip to India. Booking travel insurance isn&amp;rsquo;t very fun. I do however have a list of much less fun things:</description>
