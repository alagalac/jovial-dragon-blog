      <description>Tuesday was our last day in Thailand. In keeping with our routine, we hunted down yet another cafe. This time it was a small cafe called Ink and Lion. The cafe had a nice clean industrial look, and a cute little cartoon about the owners in the middle of the tables. For lunch we headed off to a Japanese mall. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of Japanese stuff in Thailand. The mall had a lot of Japanese stores.</description>

      <title>Our last full day in Thailand</title>

      <description>&amp;hellip;.and we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to do with ourselves! So we found the top rated coffee roastery on TripAdvisor and started our day there. TripAdvisor is very handy - we never would have found this place ourselves. It was on a random little street that didn&amp;rsquo;t look like it had much down it!   Jase thought his coffee was good and that it reminded him of his V60 coffee he makes at work.</description>

      <description>This morning started off a bit slowly. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much before 11am. However there was a reason for that (besides last night). Today we were going to the Chatuchak Market, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really open until later. Chatuchak (or Jatujak) Market is the biggest market in Thailand, and one of the largest in the world. This market extends over 27 acres, and has over 15,000 stalls. It is big.</description>

      <description>Good morning :) We were out late last night so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to blog. Yesterday began with an early start to go and watch Mari play netball.  After netball we chilled out and had lunch back at Dad&amp;rsquo;s place. We also tried out their building&amp;rsquo;s pool. The big pool was quite deep, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t touch the bottom without some effort.  After our swim we went to visit Armine&amp;rsquo;s local hairdresser, Tuk.</description>

      <description>This morning we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to do with ourselves. It seems that we&amp;rsquo;ve basically done Bangkok. All of the &amp;ldquo;Top things to to in Bangkok&amp;rdquo; lists are basically the same:
 Visit the golden palace (not really too keen at the moment what with recent events in Thailand) Visit China Town (done) See reclining Buddha (have seen enough Buddhas) Take a river cruise (done) Try street food (most of it looks very unhygienic and smells bad!</description>

      <description>G&amp;rsquo;day. Armine made us a delicious breakfast of pancakes and fruit. Yummy. Thanks Armine!  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have many plans for today so we just decided to do a mall day. But first! Coffee. :) We tried a place called Doilanka.They use local organic beans. We thought the coffee was okay, but we wished they used double shots (the same for many places here). On our way to today&amp;rsquo;s mall we passed another much fancier mall.</description>

      <description>This morning we headed off to Lumphini Park, one of the larger parks in Bangkok.  What is interesting about Lumphini Park is all of the monitor lizards hanging out in and around the lake. The lizards crawl about like mini dinosaurs and have snake-like tongues.  While walking around we could see some crazy Bangkok traffic down below.  Later on in the day it was threatening to rain heavily so we went to the cinema with Mari to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.</description>

      <description>Hi all This morning we stumbled upon a new coffee place called Alto Coffee Roasters. They had a wide variety of flavours on offer such as salted caramel and tiramisu.  After this refreshing pitstop we got on the BTS skytrain, hopping off at Saphan Taksin. We then needed to get a ferry to Memorial Bridge. There were lots of people standing around trying to ask where you wanted to go.</description>

      <description>This morning we woke up a bit later. We dropped Mari off at her school and then went on a walk with Armine. We went to a local cafe and grabbed a cup of coffee.  Continuing onwards, we stopped off at a local bakery we saw for breakfast. This was a fairly posh bakery. We even had a doorman inspect our bags before entering. Inside they had a wide variety of breads and treats.</description>

      <description>Hello all. Today was our last day in Chiang Mai. We were a bit sad to leave as we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed our time here. We also loved our cute guest house.  We went to a place called the Hideout. Jase decided that the flat white was pretty close to Wellington quality. I enjoyed a homemade hawaiian bagel and jase had their signature French toast.    After breakfast, we went to an upmarket spa (we had to book it in advance).</description>

      <description>This morning we did something a bit different and didn&amp;rsquo;t visit Café Arte. Instead we stopped over at Fahtara Coffee for breakfast. We had some gorgeous coconut and mango French toast.  Breakfasted up, we headed over to Kimmie&amp;rsquo;s dad&amp;rsquo;s hotel to await our van to head to Fight of the Gibbon.  Flight of the Gibbon is a huge zip lining tour through the rainforest in Chiang Mai. Over about three hours we swung through the rainforest on cables from one tree to the next.</description>

      <description>Kia ora. A few days ago we booked a day trip to Doi Inathon National Park through our hotel. They had a clear-folder containing tours and trips that they said they could discount. The trip operator was not often named. Usually, we book activities online following extensive research, but this time we decided to try our luck and hope for the best. We were picked up around 8.30am. I noticed that our names were the only ones on his sheet.</description>

      <description>This morning we made sure to only have a small breakfast at our local Cafe Arte. I did however have a &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; coffee. Apparently this is a new style of coffee from Melbourne which is popular here. It tastes like a smaller, stronger, darker flat white. We had the smaller breakfast because today we went off to a full day cooking class at Thai Farm Cooking School.  Coincidentally we also had some Peruvian-American in our group today who were also in our same group at Elephant Nature Park yesterday!</description>

      <description>G&amp;rsquo;day all. It&amp;rsquo;s Kimmie again. Jase will blog tomorrow since we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing an activity that Jase chose and that he wants to blog about. Today we visited the Elephant Nature Park. We chose this activity because of its ethical nature. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a sanctuary for disable/rescued elephants. You don&amp;rsquo;t ride the elephants here and they aren&amp;rsquo;t forced to perform. Usually if you visit the park as a day visitor you are put into groups and you can feed the elephants behind lines on a platform.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone. We spent today exploring Chiang Mai on foot. We walked around the old town square and a trendy neighbourhood called Nimmana. All in all over 8kms of wandering. We quite enjoy exploring new places. :-) Advanced warning: today&amp;rsquo;s blog is more food-focused than usual. Our mellow morning This morning I noticed a lantern on the roof of our hotel (see below). They are scattered all over the place in the wake of yi peng (the festival&amp;rsquo;s last night is tonight).</description>

      <description>This morning we got up early to see if the local bakery was open, since it was closed yesterday. The bakery was again not open, so we visited Je café across the road to wait until opening time (yesterday they told us it opens at 10am, even though the sign clearly had it as opening at 8am). 10am soon rolled around, and the bakery was still firmly closed. Hungry for breakfast and still not trusting any of the Indian-Italian-Thai restaurants, we went to the lowest common denominator: McDonalds.</description>

      <description>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s the last time I listen to weatherman Jason. I was about to pack an umbrella in our daypack today because I like to be prepared. But because it was hot and sunny outside (about 30 degrees) Jase assured me it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t rain and therefore we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it. Hmm&amp;hellip; But before I launch into that, I actually was a bit freaked out this morning because my neck was quite sore after a neck/head massage from yesterday.</description>

      <description>Early this morning we caught the ferry from Phuket to Ao Nang. The trip took a couple of hours, but it was pretty smooth sailing.  The ferry was pretty loud. We were seated inside the hull of the ferry. Luckily it wasn&amp;rsquo;t full, because if it was it would have been very hot and claustrophobic.  When we arrived at the pier it was a bit disorganised and we had to clamber over a couple of boats to get to the wharf.</description>

      <description>Sawasdee. Today was a &amp;ldquo;chill out&amp;rdquo; day. We basically meandered around town and stumbled upon/tried random things. We slept in until about 9am (so amazing) and then went out for a coffee. There are so many café choices here, but today we chose Macchiato house and Cakebox. It was lovely. Nice quality coffee and man, my breakfast was awesome. I ordered a Japanese maple toast dish (the recommend dish). See for yourself below.</description>

      <description>Bright and early today we packed our bags and headed off to our new hotel on the other side of the island, in Phuket Town. Our taxi driver asked us &amp;ldquo;Why you go there? There not beaches in Phuket Town&amp;rdquo;. Yes, but beaches can get a bit boring, and we like cafés. Phuket Town is the largest city in Phuket, although it&amp;rsquo;s not that big. It also has a long history which we could see in the interesting buildings and architecture.</description>

      <description>Hi all. I love a good alliteration, don&amp;rsquo;t you? :) Yesterday at lunchtime we were somewhat impulsive and bought a tour online. I always planned to show Jase Phang Nga Bay, but the weather forecast looked very dire for the rest of this week (thunderstorms were predicted for almost every day). Bad weather does not make for the best outdoor experiences. While I was uncertain about booking a tour (as they were all around 3,200 baht online or in person, or approx $125nzd per person), I still really wanted to go to Phang Nga Bay.</description>

      <description>First thing this morning we headed down to MrCoffee, our favourite little Italian cafe. It&amp;rsquo;s only about a five minute walk, and they have lots of yummy fresh baked goods. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive by Thai standards but is really tasty. Kimmie ordered a fresh mango.  After breakfast we headed back down to the same massage place we went to yesterday. Kimmie order an aromatherapy massage meanwhile I opted for the Thai massage.</description>

      <description>Sa-was-dee kap (hello) Last night we arrived at our little resort in Karon beach pretty tired and ready to sleep. I was quite relieved that we managed to reach our destination without any real issues (although it was not stress-free, e.g. figuring out the taxi system at Phuket airport). I get the feeling that a lot of the time in Thailand it&amp;rsquo;s a case of &amp;ldquo;try and hope for the best&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It turns out that the morning of the 6th of November is not a good morning to get up early. We had a 3am start, but were kept awake most of the night by fireworks! You might recall that on our Japan trip we took one bag between us. We tried to also pack light for this trip (Kimmie is becoming masterful at this :) ). Our bags totalled less than 10kg!</description>

      <description>**Kia ora everyone. Thanks for joining us again. ** It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since we posted our final thoughts on our Japan trip. This year we&amp;rsquo;re travelling to Thailand for about 3 weeks. We&amp;rsquo;ve been planning this holiday for over 6 months, and now it&amp;rsquo;s less than 6 days until we leave! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe when your holiday is this close. Suddenly, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a far away two-hour-Thai-aromatherapy-massage daydream.</description>
