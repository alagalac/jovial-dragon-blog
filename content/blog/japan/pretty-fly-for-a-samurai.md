The Onsen at this place are awesome. I swear I've had more baths in the past two days than I've had in the past two years. So far I've been having two soaks a day. They're public baths, but they're pretty hygienic. You have to completely shower and clean yourself before getting in. Everybody is naked in the baths, which takes a bit of getting used to. However when we've been we've pretty much been the only ones there. This morning we had a traditional Japanese breakfast. Like dinner there was heaps of food, and it was all pretty good. Those samurai ate like kings!

Takayama has a similar vibe to the likes of Queenstown. A fairly resorty town with lots of boutique food and items for tourists to buy. At the local market I noticed they were selling peaches at up to nearly $10 each for the very best!

A couple of times a year they have a parade with these hugely elaborate floats built over 300 years ago. They're all covered with gold and embroidery. They had a couple on display...

Many of the houses looked pretty nice, and they all had some well groomed trees.

Takayama is known for two things: Hida beef, and Sarubobo (a little red baby monkey doll). It's amazing how many stores in a single town can be dedicated to selling beef or baby monkey dolls. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0982.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0982.jpg) I saw Sarubobo t-shirts, dolls (many sizes), stickers, badges, magnets, chopsticks, umbrellas, biscuits, alcohol, hello kitty dolls wearing a sarubobo costume, and even a pair of sarubobo underwear! There's whole stores just selling products with Sarubobo on them. After a bit of shopping we came across a nice little foot bath. Open to the public, and you could sit and relax with your feet in the hot spring water.

It was pretty good. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0967.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0967.jpg) For the afternoon we went on a walk past some local temples and shrines. They were all very pretty old buildings.   \[wpvideo 4GrViuTl\]   We then went on a walk up to the ruins of Takayama castle. There were so many bear warnings on the track that I was half expecting one around every tree. I was a tad disappointed that we saw little sign of either a bear or a castle. The ruins were hardly there. I guess that's what happens when they're made out of wood. The forest it was in was very scenic though.

The meal was similar in style to last night but with different ingredients. While we were eating, the staff prepared our room with futons for sleeping.
