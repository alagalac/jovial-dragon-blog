Konochiwa. ðŸ˜Š We again slept well, but as I like to sleep on the edge of pillows, I found the tatami pillow (which was firm and wavey) a bit uncomfortable. Jase did not have any worries. This morning we had to check out of our ryokan. Before doing so, we ate our final ryokan breakfast. Once again we had 12 little dishes to devour. I definitely had my favourites, and tried to save the best for last. There are a few dishes I don't think I could get used to for breakfast no matter how much I might try to accustom myself. These include pickled vegetables and slimy squid. I noticed that the meals served at the ryokan were an interesting collision of traditional/modern and Japanese/foregin dishes. For example, breakfast could contain miso soup, rice, and edamame. It could also have a croissant, yoghurt, and other hot foods such as sausage. Before I continue, I'll tell you about this somewhat embarrassing thing that happened at breakfast... Â Last night at dinner I must have dipped my sleeve into soy sauce (so annoying because we were quite conscious of the yakuta's big baggy sleeves and tried to avoid doing this!). Somehow, the soy sauce had dripped down one side of my yakuta as well. I actually didn't notice that any of this had occurred until I had gone back to the room... Anyway, so in a vain attempt to hide the soy sauce stains I wrapped the right (my right) side of my yakuta over the left side (usually it's the other way around). I didn't think anyone would notice or care. When we arrived in the dining hall we sat down. The attendant came and pointed out to me that I had done up my yakuta wrong. She then motioned for me to tie it correctly. She just stared at me patiently, waiting for me to do it. So I awkwardly tried to do it without taking the obi belt off. That didn't really work, so she got me to face the wall and do it. I sort of felt like I had been naughty! That was a little embarrassing! Ok, next... After breakfast we packed our bags and went downstairs to relax with some complimentary coffee and newspapers (that were even in English!). The ryokan provided a free taxi service to the train station so we took advantage of this. The owner gave us a nice souvenir picture of us at the ryokan on the way out. ðŸ˜Š We really enjoyed our stay at a ryokan and would recommend that you include one in your itinerary if you are coming to Japan. We'll miss they lovely kind and warm staff, the elaborate food, the calming atmosphere... and I know Jase will miss the onsen! **Random observation:** chirpy bird noises. They are everywhere in Japan. Many pedestrian lights, onsen, train stations... Other than the ones at traffic lights, which are more high pitched, they are very nice and peaceful. Like being in a rainforest. Jase said he wishes we could have these at home. ...We caught the 9.39am local train to Toyama. The scenery on the way was quite green, much like New Zealand. Apparently 67% of Japan is covered in forest. That's quite a lot more in comparison with New Zealand, which is about 32%. (Â [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_forest_area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_forest_area)Â ) At Toyama we switched to a Shinkansen. Jase informed me that this one was the newest Shinkansen. It was pretty flash! Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1009.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1009.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1010.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1010.jpg) On the Shinkansen Jase was very excited to tuck into a salmon pizza-type meal. It definitely made his day. I suppose that cutting your sushi with a mini plastic knife is kind of thrilling...?

When we arrived at our final destination (Kanazawa) it was lightly raining. There was a fountain in front of the station that greeted everyone and told the time. There was also a tori gate. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1011.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1011.jpg) Jase was adamant that we should walk to our accommodation despite the rain. It was about a 25 minute walk. On the way, we noticed free umbrella rentals as well as cheap bike rentals. We thought that the crossings were interesting. How would you like to get to the other side? Option A, B, C or D? Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1012.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1012.jpg) We eventually found our guest house. Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1013.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1013.jpg) Our hosts are very kind and speak a little English. At this place we make up our own beds and arrange our own food. After we had settled in we decided to go for a walk. We found the geisha district, and discovered Kanazawa's mascot. We also found shops full of gold. Lots of gold. Including edible gold leaf ice cream!

Surprisingly, this was a bit of a mission. We resorted to a Japanese curry place in a mall. Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1018.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1018.jpg) It was very tranquil on our stroll back to the guest house. Crickets humming, the river flowing... Time for bed! Night. Kimmie
