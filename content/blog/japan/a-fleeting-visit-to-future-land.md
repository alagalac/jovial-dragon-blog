Today we only had a short amount of time to explore because our flight back home was at 8.30pm (and working backwards from there we only had free time until about 3pm). We decided to check out Odaiba, a man-made island that is known for its futuristic style. We had to catch 2 trains to get there, which took about 30mins in total. The view going across to Odaiba from the mainland was quite awesome. Odaiba's got a nice beach, interesting buildings, and lots of green spaces. I especially liked the look of the Fuji TV building (Jase begged to differ, he thought it was ugly). [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1383-1.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1383-1.jpg) Jase thought that the "futuristic" nature of this island was probably futuristic at the time everything was built, but not so futuristic these days. Unfortunately, it was another public holiday (yesterday was respect for the aged day). This meant huge crowds of people and long lines. It was a bit overwhelming and meant we couldn't do as much. It was also quite hot. As usual, nothing opened until 10am. We decided to start at Joypolis. This is an indoor entertainment park which specialises in virtual reality. We waited in line for just over an hour to do a ride called "Veil of Dark", a rollercoaster with virtual shooting of zombies. The ride was okay (not very scary) but it shook our heads around more than we would have liked. I ended up with a huge headache as a result. :( [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1372-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1372-0.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1370.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1370.jpg) Next we went to the Takoyaki Museum, which was more like a food court than any kind of museum. Jase bought a sampler set of takoyaki to try. He chose a type that looked like it was coated in rice bubbles. We didn't like it that much. The takoyaki we had in Osaka were far better.

We had a little browse. The variety of merchandise for purchase is quite amazing. We of course preferred to shop at places with peculiar names such as "Kiddy Land", instead of the fancy upmarket chains. There was a surprising amount of Disney stuff. Star Wars merchandise is very popular here at the moment (Star Wars items are even sold at combinis). In a mall that was Venice themed on the inside and currently advertising Tahiti, we bumped into a school group from the Waikato! Small world! They were in Japan on a 2-week trip and seemed excited to see someone from their own country.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1379.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1379.jpg) ...We were thinking of going to the science museum but the line was too long, especially because there was a Pokemon exhibition on show. The lines were also too long for the illusion museum, and even for food. The sheer number of people was just a bit too much. Crowds aren't that fun in our opinion. It made me realise that I would not be keen to live in a place with so many people. It's just a bit too claustrophobic. There were a lot of random statues on Odaiba. From a (small) Statue of Liberty replica, to a Gundam statue. It looked like several other statues would light up at night.

It's a land of amusement rides, games, and shopping. Eventually, we left Odaiba and took a few more trains than we would have liked (we caught an express by mistake which didn't stop where we wanted to get off) to get back to the hotel where we had left our bags. From there we got a few more trains to finally get on the very nice Skyliner. This goes direct to Narita Airport. It costs a fair amount for the luxury, about NZD $28.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1390.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1390.jpg) At the airport we wanted to use up our coins, which we can't convert back. As a result we have a feast of food and drink to have on our flight to the Gold Coast. We've enjoyed our time away. We've had lots of cool experiences and learnt a lot about Japan. There'll be things that we miss, but equally we are looking forward to some things back home. We'll do a final follow-up post that lists the things that we personally consider to be the wonderful, and the more annoying, things that we encountered in our travels around Japan. Bye Japan....hello home! :) -Kimmie
