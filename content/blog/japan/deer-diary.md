Konbanwa (good evening)! This morning we tried to do laundry before heading off to our next destination, Miyajima. It wasn't the best way to start the day. After our clothes came out of the dryer they weren't exactly dry (annoying since we had to pay for these facilities). Unfortunately as well, we had to check out of our hotel. So we ended up packing the damp clothes into a plastic bag (later we paid to use a better drier at our accommodation in Miyajima). The coffee we had this morning claimed to use "world beans". Not the best coffee. Mine was a third froth.

We ended up getting an assortment of yummy savoury baked treats from a bakery in Hiroshima Station. Railway stations are another great place for food, and  the shops are open before 10am! **Random observation**: baseball is big here in Hiroshima. Merchandise supporting their baseball team is everywhere, including at railway stations. We ate our breakfast whilst waiting for the train to Miyajima. The train ride was a 20 minute trip. The station we got off at to get on the ferry to Miyajima had some pretty murals.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1111.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1111.jpg) The ferry was a nice and quick 10 minute trip. From the boat we got our first glimpse of the island's "floating" Torri gate. It looked very grand. The island is very cute. It's got its own special charm. We liked the stone lanterns that dotted the coastline. The resident wild deer were particularly entertaining. We saw one tear a lady's bag when it tried to eat the contents inside. Another started to eat a man's shirt whilst he was walking... There are signs around asking people not to feed the deer, but we saw people doing it anyway. We had a nice time wandering the shops and trying the local specialties. One is called Momiji Manjyu, which is a maple leaf shaped sweet filled with one of a variety of fillings. Jase tried a cheese one and I had a chocolate one. The chocolate in mine was like a custard. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1120.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1120.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1121.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1121.jpg) We also tried fresh oyster, which they broke open in front of us. They had a few sauces to put with them, including a lemon one.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1118.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1118.jpg) We had more delicious okonomiyaki for lunch. There were some people dressed up like samurai... [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1127.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1127.jpg) A few friendly deer came up to us to say hello. They are rather friendly, and always curious to see if you have food.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1126.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1126.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1131.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1131.jpg) We wandered around the beach at low tide. At this time you can walk up and touch the Torri. Many people had put coins on the base of it where there were barnacles. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1130.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1130.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1132.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1132.jpg)  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1133.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1133.jpg) Later on we visited a peaceful temple. It had 500 unique Buddha statues, and they all had cute wollen hats on! At the moment this temple (Daisho-in) is celebrating a lantern festival, so there are lots of candles and lanterns scattered around.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1142.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1142.jpg) I got a fortune scroll. According to the scroll I should throw away "stale old habits" and then apparently things will be all good for me! It even says I  will win any lawsuits...? Our guest house is lovely. The owners are kind and want to help as much as possible. We got a tour of the house and lots of specific instructions and hints. We had to make up our futon beds, and this style was more complex. We had to follow the "how to make your futon bed" guide. We enjoyed having a porch area, we relaxed there and tried Hiroshima Cola. It had similarities with the Karma Cola that we get back home, but I thought it was even more bubbly. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1144.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1144.jpg) After dark we tried out the private bath, a nice change from the more public ones. We did miss the bird noises though... The island was also lovely and quiet to walk around at night. There are a few too many people during the day. We went around 9.30pm when it was high tide. A boat was taking tourists through the middle of the Torri. I wondered how much those people had paid for their 1 minute of thrilling excitement.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1147.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1147.jpg) We are hoping to do some walks around the island tomorrow. Maybe we might even see a monkey or two.. Until next time. -Kimmie
