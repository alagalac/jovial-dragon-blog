Konichiwa! We woke up this morning expecting better weather than yesterday because of the weather forecast predictions. I don't really trust weather forecasts, and I feel justified in my doubting ways after today's weather! It rained on and off **_all_** _**day**_. Luckily whenever the weather cleared we dried off quickly (we got wet despite the umbrella) due to the warm air. _A_ _forewarning_: as a result of the weather, today basically became a food and drink sampling day. Sorry about all of the foodie talk! I will be talking about the castle and gardens later in this post though.. Right. So for breakfast we had yogurt smoothies. Jase also had another drink to "help" the dry cough he appears to have picked up. He decided that a "medicated" blackcurrent drink would help...Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1037.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1037.jpg) ...We wanted to start the day with a nice coffee at this coffee house near the geisha district that we found when we first arrived here in Kanazawa. However, the place was not open when we went at 10am (shops don't open before 10am). So we decided to come back later. On our wet walk we spotted a small cafÃ©. We tried the coffee there but noticed they were using those weird capsule machines. The coffee was average as a result. There was also someone smoking inside - something you wouldn't see in a cafÃ© back home! At another tiny store we grabbed a freshly baked melon bread to share. This one was far superior to the one we got from a bakery in Tokyo (probably because that one had not just come out of the oven!). The one we got had icecream (I tried to order one without icecream, but oh well!). The bread itself had a fluffy texture and a bit of a vanilla taste. We found out that there's a method to eating it, whereby you use a straw at the end to drink the remaining icecream.

We found this amazing food bazaar on the basement floor. So many options. It's something useful we have learnt about Japan: if you're Â in a place that lacks eating out options like Kanazawa, a sure bet for food is either a combini or the basement floor of a mall!! We would recommend the mall food in particular. I got okonomiyaki for lunch (pictured below). It was very good. Jase got some takoyaki balls. Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1042-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1042-0.jpg) **Random** **observation**: it's rude to walk and eat in Japan. We have tried not to do this. However, we often want to sit once we have bought food. Many food places do not have anywhere nearby to sit. So often we have had to walk to find somewhere. Additionally, bins are sparsely located in Japan. It's almost exciting when you come across one and can get rid of your rubbish! After lunch, which we ended up eating in a park, we walked to Kenroku-en Park gardens. These gardens are one of the main attractions in Kanazawa. The gardens were very green. For some reason I was expecting more flowers. Maybe because in Spring all of the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Also, I guess I am used to the botanical gardens? [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1044.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1044.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1045.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1045.jpg)Â Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1048.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1048.jpg) We enjoyed our relaxing walk around the gardens (even if it was raining). The stone lanterns were nice. Jase was particularly keen on the bridges... We were intrigued by the man-made wooden stilts holding a lot of the tree branches up. I found website which explained it a little further:

> The Japanese use many means of caring for trees and encouraging growth into old age. Their love of arboriculture partially grows from the familiar forests covering nearly seven-tenths of their country. Throughout Japan you can see hundreds of young and old trees benefiting from human-made supports, fashioned from bamboo and wood timbers. For the young, these structures help manage their growth. Old trees often receive bracing for long heavy branches, helping extend for years their beauty and usefulness.

There was a cool fountain that was naturally powered. We saw a lot of dragonflies, koi fish, "water striders" (insects that move on the water's surface), cicadas, and even a Â cricket! Some women wandered the gardens in kimono. Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1050.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1050.jpg) Once again Jase found his spotlight (what a local celebrity! Haha) as some Japanese students ran after us wanting to interview him. It was part of a school project, and they were with a teacher who looked about our age. His clothing suggested that he was American. The students asked Jase what he thought about the fountain. They were a bit nervous, but also quite excited to practice their language skills.Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1056.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1056.jpg) On reflection (and, you know, to prepare for his next interview) Jase thought he might use fewer big words, so as to better tailor his response to the audience. The students did look a bit confused when he used the word "mechanical"... After wandering the gardens we had a look around the castle. Parts of the castle have been reconstructed as a result of a fire that occurred some time ago. We thought the architecture was nice. We also enjoyed the interesting flora and fauna in this area. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1058.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1058.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1061.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1061.jpg)Â **Random** **observation**: along with temples, there are many museums in Kanazawa. Of particular interest to us were the phonograph museum and a museum of wooden Japanese sweet moulds! After having a rest back at the guest house we decided to see if the cute coffee place was open. It was! I tried an interesting sweet coffee called _wasanbon_. I really liked it. Jase had a _Kanazawa_ _coffee_ which had gold flakes on top. We shared a tiny slice of homemade cheesecake with our coffees. Jase said it tasted "how cheesecake should taste". It was mild in flavour, more savoury than sweet. It also had gold flakes on top. We loved the little traditional tea house that we drank our coffees in. Very peaceful. Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1066.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1066.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1068.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1068.jpg)Â Once we had drunk our coffees a member of the staff tried to tell us something in Japanese. We obviously couldn't understand, so she helpfully gestured instead. Thank goodness for hand gestures and the kindness of Japanese people! What she was trying to tell us was that there was an interesting metalwork place connected to the tea house. She was encouraging us to check it out. It was small, and a man was working on crafting a metal squid or octopus head. His creations were pretty cool. My favourite was a reindeer with armour. The guy stopped working on his creation to talk to us. We learnt that some of the bigger structures take him about 3 months to make. We were glad that we got the chance to see this. ðŸ˜Š Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1072.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1072.jpg) ...Those of you that know Jase will know that he's a big fan of sushi. We (surprisingly) have not had sushi in Japan yet (Jase does not include onigiri). Therefore, we decided to correct this injustice by having sushi for dinner. The sushi place we chose served amazing fresh sushi. We even saw them making each piece and cutting up the ingredients. Jase went for a set menu option. I chose the more challenging, and arguably more rewarding, option where I picked individual pieces that I wanted to try. It was a very collegial sushi place. They all worked together and even shouted welcomes and thank yous to every customer. Since we were at the counter we just let the sushi chef in front of us know what we wanted. The one we had was very kind and even spoke English for us. After such good quality sushi I don't think sushi back in New Zealand will be as satisfying anymore!!! My fave was the "fatty tuna". Jase quite liked the "medium fatty tuna". I think we will be eating more sushi in Japan as a result of this experience!Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1074.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1074.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1073.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1073.jpg)Â Tomorrow we are catching 2 trains (1 Shinkansen, 1 local train) to get to Hiroshima. By the way: I hope you all don't think we are pigs and eat lots of food! We promise that we share a lot and it's not as bad as it sounds! We are just enjoying trying as many foods as possible. Catch you later! -Kimmie
