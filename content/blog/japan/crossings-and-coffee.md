So today started out much like yesterday: with onigiri. You can't go wrong with $1.50 rice triangles.

We took off to Shibuya. It's at the opposite side of the main Yamanote railway loop. So took about half an hour. The ride was still only about $2.50. The trains are pretty reasonable here.

We took the typical touristy pictures next to the hachiko statue and at the crossing.

Hachiko was a loyal dog who waited at the station every day for his master, even after the master passed away. He's become the local mascot for Shibuya.

They seem to be big on uniqueness in Japan. Every station on the Yamanote line has its own jingle which plays when the train stops there. Ueno station near where we're staying has a panda mascot since its got pandas at the zoo.

From Shibuya we went on a walk. On the way Kimmie spotted a Disney store. It had three stories of everything Disney. You had to climb a spiral staircase to get to the top. Apparently the range was better than the stores in America.

We walked through to Omotesando, a really nice, leafy, trendy suburb. If I was to move to Tokyo, I'd like to live there! Down the Main Street they had all of the high fashion brands like Louis Vitton.

There were a surprising amount of people doing photo shoots in public.

They had some really great cafes. The first one we went to was called 'Island Vintage Coffee' and was vaguely Hawaiian themed. The drinks were really good and had a coconut flavour to them.

Next we went to Omotesando Koffee. This was an awesome little traditional coffee shop tucked away in the residential area. They also sold some delicious toasted coffee custard.

We meandered our way to Takeshita-Doori, a famous busy street with lots of teenagery shops and crepes. We ordered a chocolate strawberry and banana cream crepe. You could even get ones with creme brûlée or brownie in them.

There were lots of very colourful shops, and crazy fashion.  One had amazing costumes, but were weren't supposed to take photos. I snuck one of the outside anyway.

Next up we visited the nearby Yoyogi park. The Japanese sure know how to do parks. Yoyogi is a massive tranquil island in the middle of the city. The park was really beautiful with lots of old trees. We had to watch out for hornets though. Only saw a couple.

In the below picture Kimmie is at one of the entrances to the park. She's holding some random Pringle freebies that we got given.

I'm the middle of the park there's the Meiji shrine. The shrine itself is beautiful. It reminded me of the Taj Mahal with all of the symmetry and the majesty of the building.

We were lucky enough to see a traditional wedding procession go past. Later we cause the train home and had some yakitori and melon bread for dinner.
