Today started with a rush for the train. There were no more reserved seats available on the JR Thunderbird, so we had to wait in line for the first in, first served unreserved seats. Luckily we managed to grab some! After passing through some tunnels we came out on the other side of the island. We sped past Kyoto which was hot and sunny. Hopefully the weather will still be like that when we visit in a week's time. It makes a change from the misty drizzly weather we've had the past few days. In Osaka we made a transfer to the Sukura Sinkansen super express. At least we had reserved seats for this train, but it was still a scramble to find some ekiben and drinks to eat on the train. I ended up getting a thirty flavour bento set, while Kimmie grabbed the ginger pork special (an old favourite).

She's been to Japan over a dozen times! Arriving in Hiroshima we had to get out our umbrella for an entirely different purpose than usual: to provide some shade from the hot sun! After dropping our bags off at the hotel we meandered down to the Hiroshima peace park where the atomic bomb was dropped. We opted to go into the museum first to get out of the sun. The museum was very well done, and a very sobering experience. It really highlighted the human impact of the atomic bomb, and how many innocent people lost their lives. Many school children were caught up on the blast, and their school uniforms were on display. It was amazing the sheer devistation caused, and the indescribable pain and suffering which happened to those who were unfortunate enough not to die immediately. It's hard to imagine the pain of watching your own skin melt off of your body. It was a powerful message that nuclear weapons should be banned. Afterwards we went for a stroll around the park. It's actually a really beautiful place. We saw the peace flame, which will keep burning until all nuclear weapons are abolished.

There's some really nice tree lined boulevards, and there's a bunch of padestrian malls. Down one of these malls we came across an arcade which had the table flipping game I'd been looking for. The objective of the game is to flip a table, causing as much damage as possible. I was pretty excited.   \[wpvideo 0hv6Exmj\] Later we went off in search of Hiroshima's most famous culinary contribution: okonomiyaki.

Every floor had half a dozen different Okonomiyaki places, each slightly different. We ate at two of them and they were both really delicious. One of our favourite Japanese foods!

It's much better here than in Wellington. There's far more  (English) songs, they're newer, and it's cheaper.
