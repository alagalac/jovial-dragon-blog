Jase has been looking forward to today, because he was excited to see monkeys. Today was monkey mountain day. We caught a local train from Kyoto to Saga-Arashiyama Station. It was a lovely day and many people were taking advantage of it by hiring bikes. The first thing we did was to check out the bamboo grove. It's nice and shady under the tall bambo. We enjoyed a nice stroll surrounded by bamboo. However, we think it would have been even more peaceful without cars, and more beautiful without powerlines. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1305.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1305.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1283.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1283.jpg) Surrounded by the bamboo groves was a cute little temple called Tenryū-Ji Temple. We decide to take a look. It's a World Heritage Site. Apparently it was established in 1339, however the temple has been ravaged by eight fires since its founding. Therefore the current buildings only date from 1868. The temple is called the "Temple of the Heavenly Dragon". Apparently the first ever zen garden was/is located here. The temple was nice to wander around.  It's the time of year when the leaves are starting to turn autumn orange colours.

Emerging from the bamboo groves, we saw a nice, big, fast flowing river. It appeared to have a pathway along the edge of it. So we decided to go along it. It was a very pleasant stroll. Along the way we spotted another of those amazing coffee places, _%_ _Arabica_. It was obviously meant to be, so we had a coffee pit stop there. The river had quite a few different types of boats/dingys that you could pay to use/ride on. It looked like a fun activity, but we just decided to watch. There were interesting animals/insects in the vicinity such as dragonflies; we even managed to spot a frog that jumped across the path. On the way back from our stroll beside the river, we were confronted by a huge mob of little school children about 5 years old. We saw groups like this at the aquarium yesterday. They are all pretty adorable in their unifroms! They greeted us with what we think is probably the only English they know: "Hello! Have a nice day!" How sweet, and polite! :) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1285.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1285.jpg)[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1286.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1286.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1304.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1304.jpg) It was time for monkey mountain (also known as Arashiyama Monkey Park). The path up to the top was a bit of a hike. Good thing  there was a pop quiz along the way to entertain/distract us. We were glad that the destination at the top was  more exciting than the journey today. In fact chilling out with these cool native monkeys was definitely worth it. There was a wonderful vista of Kyoto as well. We had to abide by certain rules when interacting with the monkeys. We weren't allowed to stare them in the eyes or crouch down. We also had to feed them in a specific area. We were even lucky enough to watch their feeding time, whereby crazy circus type music was played. We also saw some very cute baby monkeys.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1288.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1288.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1293.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1293.jpg)  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1295.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1295.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1299.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1299.jpg) It was pretty cool being surrounded by monkeys. We thought the stamp here was cute (you can get a stamp for everything in Japan). [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1306.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1306.jpg) We had a nice lunch with local vegetable produce. Unfortunately it was served with _green tea_ and_ green tea_ dessert, neither of which I could stomach. We had a look around a few shops when we got back to Kyoto, and then decided to relax at the apartment for a few hours. We also tried the interesting German blood orange wine we had found at an "international" store that stocked imported goods. It was like (good) alcoholic fanta. For dinner we tried an Italian place we had found earlier at Kyoto Station. It was good despite the chilled red wine and the French flags on the food (maybe they thought since they have a similar pattern no one would notice? French flags might be easier to find here as well, as there seems to be a lot of French fashion style, music, and restaurants around).  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1307.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1307.jpg) We tried to reserve seats on the Shinkansen back to Tokyo tomorrow morning, but they were all sold out! Hopefully we can get some non-reserved seats tomorrow!! This could be a challenge... Ciao! -Kimmie
