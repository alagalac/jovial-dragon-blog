So today started out much like any other day: with convenience store onigiri (filled rice triangles wrapped in seaweed). It's a pretty good cheap, filling breakfast. Kimmie had gyoza. The combini of Japan are much more convenient that the dairies back home. For a start the combini are fairly cheap, but they're also everywhere. At times literally every street block has at least one combini. They have a pretty good range. Lots of snacks, drinks, sushi, hot food, and some pretty cheap alcohol. Seriously, a 2 litre bottle of whiskey for about $20!?

We'd planned to visit the Kenrokuen garden and the castle today, but decided to wait until tomorrow. Instead, we headed off to the gold leaf museum. Kanazawa is famous for its gold leaf production. They produce 99% of Japan's gold leaf. At the museum we saw how they make it. It's quite an elaborate process which involves about a dozen different stages of hammering the gold into ever finer sheets between specially crafted paper. They have some heavy machinery to help with the hammering, which you wouldn't want to get your thumbs caught in! Next up we caught an odd little bus into the centre of Kanazawa. We had to stand near the back where there wasn't really enough head room, so we had to duck our heads!

Even though it's never been home to any ninjas (only samurai) it's recieved that name because of the large number of trap doors and hidden passages through the building. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1025.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1025.jpg) We went on a tour which took about an hour. It was all in Japanese, but luckily they provided us with an English guidebook so we could follow along. Myoryuji Temple is a four-storey (appears to be two-storey from the outside: it was designed this way because in the Edo period buildings of more than two storeys were prohibited), seven level building with 23 rooms and 29 staircases! It was originally built so that samurai could spot and warn the main castle about any invaders. Actually seeing all of the trap doors, hidden rooms, false stairs, secret  tunnels, and even the seppuku room was pretty neat. It's interesting to know that all of these actually exist in real life. It's a shame we couldn't take photos. After the ninja temple we went for a walk about the city. While we were on the street I was stopped by a camera crew for a local TV station wanting to interview foreign tourists about Kanazawa. Their questions were a bit odd. They asked what I thought about Japanese people using gold leaf when their national stereotype was them being shy. I didn't really have a response to that! They also asked what I thought about the local food.
