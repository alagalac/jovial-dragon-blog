Aloha! After eating the complementary breakfast provided at our hotel we headed off to Shinjuku. Shinjuku is full of tall buildings with lots of signs and lights. There were big screen adverts an people trying to sell you things.

So many noises and funky smells. I felt that I my senses were being constantly assaulted. One of the first things we did today was try a coffee from a cafe set up by an Australian. It wasn't bad, Jase did wish his coffee was stronger. We wondered if this was on purpose to cater to local tastes? We did appear to be the only foreigners there... We headed over to the Government Metropolitan Building. We had read that you could go up to the 45th level observation deck for free. Other towers you have to pay to see the view.

We went to the north tower, and we were glad we did. Amazing views of Shinjuku and beyond. It was quite fascinating looking across the urban landscape. Some cool buildings. I noticed there was an Eiffel Tower lookalike. It was lovely weather today, but still not perfect enough to see Mt Fuji in all its glory. I can image that on such a perfect day many people would be taking photo proof! We decided to eat at the restaurant on the observation deck. It was a good choice as we got to eat right next to a beautiful view. Reasonably priced food too considering the location and how posh everything was (classy music, white pillars, a piano in the centre). After soaking up the view for as long as possible we headed back down in the elevator. Going down so many floors so fast makes your head feel weird. We had to pop out ears a few times to relieve the pressure! 

Wandering the streets of Shinjuku we saw some interesting promotions. There was one where you had to pull a rope and it told you the amount of kg you could pull. Next we went to Shinjuku Gyoen park, which was rated the number 1 attraction on TripAdviser. The park had a warning sign about mosquitos. I knew that was going to mean I'd be bitten. :( Sure enough, I left with about 6 bites. At least the bites I he here in Japan don't seem to linger as long as they do back home. They also disappear after half a day. Anyway the park itself costs a few dollars to enter. It's worth it though. It's a big park with lots of variety. There's open spaces, shaded areas, and different gardens. We especially enjoyed chilling out under the maple leaf trees, which have shed their leaves a lot even though it's only the start of autumn.

This park looks like a great place for families, couples, or for those wanting to have a nap or to read a good book. It was quite peaceful. Well, peaceful to an extent. At times there were weird loudspeaker announcements and also noises from the street (e.g. sirens). After relaxing here we had a bit of a look at the shops around Shinjuku. It was good to see what a Don Quiote was, and we enjoyed the massage chairs at the Bic store. We also played a few games in some arcades. We aren't keen on the noise and the smokiness of arcades so didn't stay long.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1330.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1330.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1331.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1331.jpg) We had some ramen for dinner and watched a local singer perform on stage. We had time to kill before our last activity. We didn't really feel that comfortable in the seedy red light district area in the evening. As well as the overall sleezy vibe, there were people trying to come up and hassle us. Our last activity was the Robot Restaurant. Waiting in the bar before the show, there was lots of colour and glimmer. It was a mish-mashed rainbow of randomness. There was a band playing with some guys dressed like robots. It was entertaining. I have mixed feelings about the show itself. While it tried to be fun and entertaining (Jase was very enthusiastic and had a great time :) ) I couldn't help but think it was a bit odd, and a bit tacky. It was obviously geared towards tourists. I thought the storyline could have been better and there were lots of "stalling" scenes and intermissions. We got to be really close to the floats because the show arena itself is small and there were only 3 rows on both sides. As a result I noticed that the floats were a bit worn and needed some maintenance. There were scratches and chunks torn off some robots. Having said that, it was fun because it was new and unusual. I am glad I got to experience this very bizarre show. Would rate 4/5 for the experience.

I got some on my camera though. Okay time for bed. Night!
