We started off today with a trip to the local coffee shop. The sun was shining and it was already getting hot, so we opted for the ubiquitous iced coffee. They're far more popular here than back home. Once we were caffeinated up, we hit the trail to start our ascent of Mount Misen. Mount Misen is the tallest peak on Miyajima. At 535m, it's pretty high (For reference, that's about the same height as Kapiti Island's summit). We took the Omoto track up. The Omoto track is the longest track and is a bit out of the way from the ferry terminal, so most of the tourists avoid it. That was good for us as it meant we pretty much had the whole track to ourselves. It was shaded under the green forest the entire way, which was a relief given how hot and sunny it was. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1155.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1155.jpg) There were lots of stairs, and the path snaked around huge moss covered boulders. Speaking of snakes, there was a poisonous snake warning sign, so Kimmie was continuously on the lookout. At one point she was spooked by something slithery off the path until I pointed out that it was just a large skink. The hike up took about two hours. At the top there were a number of shrines, including one with a flame which has been burning for over 1,200 years. This was the flame used to light the Hiroshima peace flame (and by extension the peace flame in the Wellington botanical gardens). [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1157.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1157.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1156.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1156.jpg) At the summit there was also a nice lookout tower. It had an awesome 360 degree view.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1162.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1162.jpg) If you were a bit lazy or time-poor you could catch the rope way up to a point near the summit. We went over to the rope way building and found a place where we could practice making momiji manjyu (little maple leaf shaped cakes filled with red bean, it's one of the local specialties). We tried our hand at it and ended making half a dozen. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1171.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1171.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1174.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1174.jpg) The actual process is pretty easy. You just add the batter to the mould, pop in the filling, and cover with more batter and then cook. Down in the town we saw some big machines in action which automated the whole process. We took a different route down the mountain. This path was more exposed, and much steeper with lots of steps. We were glad we didn't climb that way up! It followed a river and we could see it had been washed out in the past in a few places. They must get bad flash flooding here. For dinner we went to one of the few places left open after the tour group hoards leave for the day (about 5pm). I found the music choice most curious. They must have been after some western style music. What they had was Mariah Carrey's top Christmas hits. So we ate dinner listening to 'Santa Clause is coming to town' and some happy-clappy song about Jesus's birthday. - Jason P.S. Kimmie brought a friend into our room. He must live at the guest house.
