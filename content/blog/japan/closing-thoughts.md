The good:

*   Japan was actually surprisingly green. In the cities, only the flat land is built on, and the hills are left for forest reserves. When you get outside of the cities, the countryside is mostly hilly forests, with the occasional cute traditional town and rice paddies.
*   The Shinkansen trains were pretty amazing. Far more comfortable, and way less hassle than flying. The rides were really smooth too.
*   At one point in Kyoto the train to Osaka was three minutes late, and we had somebody come out onto the platform to apologise to us. Some Italians near by piped up "Don't worry about it. back home we're used to trains being an hour late!". The trains were so timely that we'd know which stop to get off based on what the time was ("Our train isn't due to arrive at our stop until 11.54, so this one can't be our stop").
*   The Japanese are the masters of branding. Every city, town, prefecture, and suburb has it's own local speciality and an accompanying mascot. Each place will then have plenty of stores selling every kind of souvenir related to this icon. Some examples: Shibuya has the dog Hachiko, Takayama has the monkey Sarubobo, Miyajima has maple leaf momiji.
*   The food in Japan is pretty cheap. You can find a really good meal for under $10. Alcohol was also noticeably cheaper than in New Zealand.
*   Convenience stores (Combini) are everywhere, and they're open 24/7. This means that you're never far from a quick and cheap meal.
*   The Japanese really know how to do a good park. Yoyogi and Ueno parks in Tokyo were really nice and peaceful, and on a whole another level than the parks which you find in New Zealand cities.
*   Everybody was very kind and friendly.
*   The high-tech toilets in Japan make ours look antiquated. So many features!
*   People weren't trying to rip us off all the time. In NZ you generally expect shops to jack up their prices if they're near a popular tourist destination, however they didn't seem to do that to the same extent in Japan.
*   Most signs were in both Japanese and English. This made it really easy for us to get around. Most Japanese people understood a little bit of English, however you had to try and use terms which they'd know. For example when ordering coffee they understood "take out", but not "take away".
*   Kimmie in particular loved the warm weather! :)
*   We liked how pedestrian/cycle friendly Japan was.
*   Japan is fairly safe. People left their keys in their car and didn't even bother to lock up their bikes!

The bad:

*   Rubbish bins are extremely rare in Japan. This means that you generally need to carry around your rubbish with you all day!
*   The food courts in mall basements are amazing, but usually don't have any seating. It's also rude to walk and eat in Japan, so we often had the problem that we'd just bought some amazing food, but there wasn't really any way to eat it!
*   There's plenty of variety in Japanese food, but it's all Japanese variety. That means: Japanese style curry, okonomiyaki, ramen, Japanese steak house, sushi, yakitori. Any international foods are Japanese variations on the international foods. Japanese curry generally involves a deep-fried pork cutlet with some odd "curry flavour" sauce and rice. Japanese Italian places never seem very authentic.
*   Power lines are generally all strung from power poles above ground. This makes the city streets look really ugly. You'd have thought that a place like Japan could afford to put them underground!
*   The Japanese cities are all pretty generic with boxy grey concrete buildings. The only difference between quite a few of the cities is the name. It gave the cities a very utilitarian look. Another thing I noticed is that they have a lot of railway lines, roads, and overpasses which cut right through residential or scenic areas which would just never be built in NZ due to the Resource Management Act and people complaining.
*   The animal cafes were alight, but you did feel a bit sorry for the animals. The owls in the owl cafe looked like they didn't appreciate being patted all the time, and probably wanted to sleep.
*   Sometimes they had eastern style toilets which we weren't very keen on. They just were never as clean, and are more awkward to use.
*   Quite a few people smoke in Japan. Smoking is also still allowed in hotels, arcades, restaurants, cafes, bars, and trains. We had a couple of meals which weren't very enjoyable because we were seated next to some smokers.
*   In quite a few of the manga stores they don't mark where the R18 section of the store begins. So you'll be innocently walking down an aisle only to glance at the covers of the books and see that they're all very dodgy. Some would probably be considered illegal in NZ!
*   Arcades and many stores were very loud. There was music and video coming at your loudly from every angle. It got a bit too much.
*   There was a lack of consistency. Elevators were up on the left sometimes, and other times is was the right. The same for the side of the stairs you were meant to walk up. Also, some items you bought were priced +GST, others had it included.
*   You stand out a lot as a foreigner. Sometimes this can make you feel a bit like an alien.
*   The way their currency worked meant that you generally ended up with lots of coins weighing you down. Everyone paid with cash as well, unlike in NZ where eftpos/credit card is popular.
*   Japan had some highly efficient systems (e.g their trains), but a lot of the counter service (e.g. to  book a train ticket) was quite slow.
*   We are used to not having to line up for things. So it was hard to adapt to waiting in lines for places to eat and for quite a few attractions.

The odd:

*   People sometimes complain about commercialising cultures. Well the Japanese are the masters of commercialising their own culture! For every shrine, attraction, or event there's guaranteed to be a Hello Kitty key chain for it.
*   Sushi is surprisingly not that common in Japan. There's a higher concentration of sushi stores in Wellington than there is in Tokyo. The style of sushi in Japan is quite different from what we're used to in NZ. They generally don't have takeaway sushi, or sushi rolls like we do. The fatty tuna sushi pieces in Japan are amazingly good though.
*   The main meats in Japan were pork and fish. We saw a couple of places which served beef, but chicken was pretty rare. We didn't see any places which served lamb while we were there.
*   Tokyo was actually a surprisingly great city. I was expecting Tokyo to be just a huge generic city, but it's actually an amazing city, and far nicer than the smaller cities such as Kyoto and Kanazawa. The sheer quantity and variety of things to do in Tokyo was mind boggling. Tokyo has basically has it all. All the shopping, food, entertainment, and activities you could ever need.
*   A few times the mens urinals were visible from outside the toilet block, so people outside could see guys doing their business! The female cleaners often were inside, cleaning the mens toilets while people were still using the urinals etc.
*   There were a number of places where you could buy and trade polaroid photographs of female signers and actors. It was a bit creepy.
*   Vending machines came in handy. There were all over the place, including scenic areas where maybe they weren't needed...
