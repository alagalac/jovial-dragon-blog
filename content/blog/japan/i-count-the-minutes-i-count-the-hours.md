Hello! For those of you who don't know, this blog post title is inspired by a Ricky Martin song. Yes...anyway... Check out our packed bags: [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0805.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0805.jpg) Can you believe how little we are taking? We are sharing that black bag. I sure never thought I'd see a day where I would take such a small bag on an overseas trip. That black bag actually has another smaller bag in it. Just in case we want to buy anything... Also, I added pretty coloured ribbon. I thought it might help our bag stand out amongst all those other black bags. I am not imagining they will all be there by the time we get back. It's a bit of a game to see how many survive. Okay anyway it's time to go to bed. Woo! The adventure begins tomorrow: to Auckland we go! Ciao. Kimmie
