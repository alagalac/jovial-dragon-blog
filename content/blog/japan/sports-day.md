As some of you may know, Kimmie is a bit of a roller coaster nut. Japan has some pretty crazy roller coasters but we haven't been able to fit any into our schedule. So to appease her, this morning we went over to the Tokyo Dome. Tokyo Dome is Tokyo's main baseball stadium in the middle of Tokyo. Baseball is the most popular sport in Japan, and every city has its own team. Tokyo Dome also conveniently has an amusement park and mall attached to it. We made beeline for the Dome's only roller coaster, Thunder Dolphin. I'm guessing the name is because it sounds like thunder roaring past, and the track goes through the middle of a ferris wheel like a dolphin through a hoop.

Unlike most theme parks, this one's in the middle of the city and you actually pass through a building so it's a really cool backdrop. Kimmie wanted go on the roller coaster again, but I wasn't so keen on the idea! Instead, we wandered around and found the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., a restaurant based off of Forest Gump. We ended up having a huge meal with heaps of different types of shrimp! Next up we came across an indoor golf and baseball place. It was really interesting to watch. People were inside playing golf where you hit the ball at a sheet and it projects where it would have gone like a video game. The indoor baseball was interesting as you could see a virtual pitcher on a screen throwing the ball before it comes at you out of the wall. We tried to get into the haunted house at the amusement park, but there was a two hour queue. The log ride also had a huge queue. Instead we hopped on the train over to the sumo wrestling stadium. It was lucky that we'd booked tickets in advance, as they were completely sold out. The lower ranked matches started at about 10am, but like us most people didn't arrive until about 3pm when the higher ranked matches began. I really enjoyed the sumo wrestling. It's actually a really good sport to watch. Each wrestler only fights one round, but they have every wrestler fighting once every day so it gives you the opportunity to see all of the best wrestlers every day. Each round begins with up to 4 minutes of build up where the wrestlers do a bit of a ceremony.They wash themselves, throw salt, stomp, slap their thighs, and size up their opponent. Then you get about 10 seconds of intense action as they try to wrestle each other out of the ring.

There's a huge amount of ceremony and tradition which goes into the sport. The stadium is custom built with a small shrine hovering in the middle. The referees all wear very elaborate kimonos. Much of what the wrestlers do in the warm up to each fight is something related to the traditional Japanese belief system, such as throwing salt to ward off evil spirits. The wrestlers all had their hair done up in an ancient traditional style.

The popular wrestlers tended to have traditional silk flags with paid advertising circling the arena while they were getting ready. After the conclusion of the day's sumo wrestling we hopped on an absolutely packed train back to our hotel. Luckily we only had to travel one stop! On the way home Kimmie spotted some famous fish we'd seen before and wanted to try. We had a sweet potato variant (the usual flavour was red bean), which was alright.
