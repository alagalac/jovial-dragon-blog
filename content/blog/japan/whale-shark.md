We made good time this morning getting up and hopping on the train. This time we went to Inari station, which is next to the famous Fushimi Inari shrine. Fushimi Inari shrine is a shrine dedicated to wealth, prosperity, and a good harvest. One of the key symbols is the fox, and there were many fox statues around the shrine.

It's quite a sight walking through a tunnel of red-orange gates.

It was a much easier walk than Mount Misen the other day. However at the  top there wasn't really much to see. I guess this was one of those spots where it's the journey and not the destination! Next up we decided to go on a bit of a day trip over to Osaka. Osaka is one of Japan's largest cities, and is pretty much Tokyo's smaller brother. It's also less than 30 minutes from downtown Kyoto. It's interesting how close Japan's cities are to one another. Osaka is where Takoyaki originates from, so of course we had to try some. Luckily there was a small shop by the subway station. At 10 for about $4 you couldn't go wrong! They were really delicious, and much better than what you get back home.

Kaiyukan is one of the world's largest, and it was pretty impressive. They had heaps of animals, including a huge central tank with a couple of whale sharks.

I've not been in an aquarium where you could do that before! I did feel sorry for a few of the animals though. The dolphin and penguin enclosures seemed a bit small for them. Kimmie spotted the Osaka Ferris wheel nearby so we caught a ride.

Lots of it was very cutesy, like a Pikachu wearing a Charizard costume.
