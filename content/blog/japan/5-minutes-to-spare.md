So the day started early. We checked out of the Ibis at 4am. We never saw the hotel in the daylight.

Our plane was the second one of the day. Conveniently Auckland has KFC at the airport. How convenient? Popcorn chicken for brekky it was. The first flight was pretty uneventful. I was hoping the Gold Coast airport would have another KFC so I could take a bucket on the next plane for lunch. Unfortunately it didn't. They did have some charging stations so Kimmie took the chance to play Pokemon.

The plane to Japan was one of the fancy new dreamliners, so it was a nice (but long) flight.

It seems that every country has a bit of a different smell when you step out of the plane. Australia has a dry desert smell like the air is fresh off the outback. Japan air has a more sulfuric smell like it's fresh off a volcano. One thing I can say though is that Japan is hot and very humid. I'm glad I didn't bring my jacket with me! I think my jeans will see little use. It's a huge contrast coming from a Wellington winter.

The customs were pretty light, but pretty slow. It's already interesting seeing how many people get employed just to guide other people. There was a guy who's sole job was to direct people to lines. There were people employed to help you get your bags on and off the escalator. There was somebody who's job was to help lost tourists buy train tickets. 

We finally arrived at Ueno station at exactly 9:35. We opted for the slightly slower train, but it was half the price. Walking out if the station we got our first good view of the city.

Lots of lights and lots of nightlife. Check in closed at our hotel at 10pm. We made it with 5 minutes to spare. After the quick walk we were sweating in the lobby while they did the paperwork. We'd never heard so many thank you's in a 5 minute exchange before. The actual hotel room is very compact, but for a cheap place in a good location in Tokyo you can't complain. It has everything we need, including a nice cold shower and air con!
