We made it to the station this morning in good time. We arrived just after one Shinkansen left, so we were first in line for the next one. It was already pretty full when we hopped on, but we managed to get a couple of seats next to one another. After each station more people got on. By the time we reached Tokyo there were quite a few people standing, and they had been for well over an hour! Tokyo station itself was very busy and very claustrophobic. Unlikely Kyoto station, Tokyo station looks pretty old, and is a bit of a rabbit warren with some very low ceilings (I had to watch my head). Fortunately we're a bit experienced with the Japanese railways by now, so we quickly found our connection and escaped on another train. All in all we spent less than 5 minutes in Tokyo station. Another connection later and we made it to our stop at Asakusabashi. Â I was a bit confused about where we were because the maps at the station were not oriented North! After dropping our bags off at the hotel we hopped back on the trains and scooted off to Ueno. Once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to get around even if you need to make a few connections. By now it was really hot. Far hotter than back in Kyoto. Ueno park was a lifesaver as the leafy trees gave us some much needed shade! It felt really nice strolling amongst the greenery. Our objective was Ueno Zoo, located in the park. Ueno Zoo is Japan's oldest zoo. Even though it's about the same size as Wellington Zoo, it has a surprisingly large range of animals. At the zoo we saw gorillas, tigers, lions, a polar bear, rhinos, and giant pandas.

They have heaps of panda advertising And merchandise. I found them to be a bit underwhelming though. They just kinda sat there lounging around. Given that the zoo had so many animals in a reasonably small area, it's not surprising that many of the enclosures looked a bit on the small side for the animals. Once again the zoo felt a bit cruel. It also looked like it could do with a bit of renovation. At least the entry was pretty cheap at about $8 each. To be honest while Wellington Zoo doesn't have all of the 'big ticket' animals Ueno Zoo does, I felt like the quality of the enclosures and the whole experience in general is better at Wellington Zoo. Overall it feels good to be back in Tokyo. Tokyo is a nice city. Until next time - Jason
