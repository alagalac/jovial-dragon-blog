Konichiwa! We left Miyajima this morning with stiff leg muscles after yesterday's climb, but not before trying another local coffee place. This one was actually quite good. They even drew cool designs on the froth. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1185.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1185.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1186.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1186.jpg)We observed that good coffee is more expensive in Japan compared to back home, at around $5-$6 a coffee. Jase got a photo from the ferry. You can see the Torii in the distance. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1188-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1188-0.jpg) We caught a local train and then a Shinkansen to get to Kyoto. Kyoto Station is huge. It has lots of stairs and escalators. It even has a sky bridge. Suffice to say that it appeared more like an airport than a train station. Pictures can't properly illustrate the size of this place. In New Zealand the advertising is quite 2D. It's more dynamic in Japan. Kyoto Station demonstrated this point, with a rotating slideshow beamed across a large staircase.  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1195.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1195.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1202.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1202.jpg) We are staying in a nice new (about 2 years old) apartment whilst in Kyoto, which is about 15mins walk from the station. It's lovely having a place to ourselves. We even have our own little kitchen and a washing machine. We do wish there were utensils and cooking equipment to be able to more effectively use the kitchen though. We'll have to stick to food that can be refrigerated or microwaved. We also ended up buying some soap as there was none provided (there are about 8 toothbrushes though?). **Random** **observation**: public toilets in Japan often don't provide soap or hand drying facilities. The area around Kyoto Station is like a maze of malls. We walked through about 4 or 5 which were right next to each other. Some were even linked together. It was all a bit overwhelming. Luckily Jase seems to have a much better sense of direction than me, because he seemed to navigate us around okay. I think I probably would have gotten lost! This map contains 3 malls: [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1189.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1189.jpg) For dinner we tried a place in ramen alley on the 10th floor of Kyoto Station. It's a bit stressful figuring out ramen ordering machines. Not only are we kind of guessing and going off pictures, but we couldn't really figure out the correct order in which to use the machine (when to press what buttons). I guess it takes practice. After you've paid the machine and obtained your food tickets you generally have to sit or stand outside the shop and wait to even get into the place of your choice to eat. Some people were having to wait a while in long lines! After dinner we enjoyed wandering around the giant train station. Jase particularly liked the skyway, which is an overbridge on the same floor as the ramen shops. It's dark and  quiet. Great free views too!

It reminded me of Vegas. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1200.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1200.jpg) My initial impression of Kyoto is that it is not quite what I was expecting. For some reason I did not envision such an urban city. The tourist pictures are quite different, and don't really focus on the urban landscape I suppose. I guess I'll see more of what I imagined tomorrow, when we are near Gion. Ciao for now. -Kimmie
