Konichiwa! It's me again (Kimmie), because I wanted to describe my maiko experience in more detail than Jase could. So he'll blog the next two days. This morning we braved the public transport to get to my appointment at the maiko makeover place near Gion. I was nervous about being late and not being able to find the place. Luckily we found it with the help of google maps! I was expecting the place to be full of girls wanting to be made up, but at 10am I was one of only two. This was great as I felt more relaxed and knew that they weren't in a rush to do my hair etc. When I left the studio after my experience there were a lot more people. Before I arrived I convinced myself that I would not buy any add-ons. I crumbled on that promise a little. I didn't mind doing so too much, since I had gotten a really good deal on the package. The main thing I said I wouldn't do was pay for a "half wig". All plans come with a "full wig" option. However, after seeing the difference between people wearing a full wig vs a half wig I decided to give in and pay the extra. A half wig is where they use parts of your real hair and blend it in with the wig so that it looks more natural. This way you can't really see the wig lines and it looks deceptively like everything is your own hair. In the end, I am glad that I did this. It looked quite cool. Once I had been asked lots of questions and filled out a few things at the reception I was ushered upstairs to get changed into a thin white cotton robe. I wasn't sure how to tie it up but luckily the staff were very helpful. Next up was the makeup room. The makeup artist put a hairnet on me and then started applying layer upon layer of makeup to my face and neck. There were white paints/creams and powders. Red and black brow and eye pencils were used. My lips were painted red. After a while the makeup seemed heavy on my face and I almost felt it was a ploy to ensure that I couldn't easily smile with my teeth! I probably needed that extra encouragement to force my mouth from smiling since that's pretty natural to me! The makeup artist did a great job. It's quite an impressive skill to be able to do maiko/geisha makeup! I was offered false eyelashes to purchase. I knew that was at least one thing I didn't need, since I already have sufficient eyelashes. False eyelashes are popular here, and I have noticed they are sold all over the place in Japan. Next up was the hair station. Hair wigs lined a wall full of lockers. The hair stylist chose one she thought best suited me. Mine had a red hair piece in the bun part. The wigs are heavy! I thought that it would fall off! A black stick with what appeared to be super hair gel (at times my hair was hovering in mid hair by itself!) was used to blacken my hair and fix it to the wig (with the help of hair pins too). I was quite intrigued by this instrument. A red bow was added to the front of the wig and then I was sent to the kimono and hair accessory room. I got to choose my kimono. I could have spent a while deciding but I kind of fell in love with the one I chose, which was one of the first I noticed. It is quite a process getting dressed into a kimono. There are multiple layers and ropes. It was like a big corset. I kept thinking that I felt like a cylinder. I got to choose a matching obi belt from about 4 that a lady had picked out to match with the kimono. She accessoried my hair with some amazing pieces. I love the dangly ones (these are upwards of $150 a piece in the stores where I found them). Then once I was all finished they took some photos of me, and then we had 10mins to take our own pictures outside. When I went outside I got to try wearing those wedge jandals with the two toed socks. They are challenging to go up and down stairs with, but I got the hang of walking in them pretty quickly. I found it fun, but I can imagine that long distance they would be annoying and not very practical. Here are a few pics Jase took on his phone (the tail of the kimono is tied up when walking outside): [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1212.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1212.jpg)  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1210.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1210.jpg)  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1213.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1213.jpg) After our 10mins was up a lady helped to take the white makeup off the back of my neck but I had to do the rest by myself. It was hard work getting it off (good thing they provide lots of tissues, baby oil, moisturiser, cleanser etc). The most difficult thing was washing the black paint out of my hair using only a low hand basin and their shampoo/conditioner. I had to wash my hair twice! After that wonderful experience we decided to go to a local coffee place which Jase found while he was waiting. It was called **_% Arabica_**. Jase rated it as "very good". He even said it was comparable to the best coffee in Wellington: high praise! We saw the nearby Kiyomizudera temple but didn't go inside the main building as it was under renovation. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1218.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1218.jpg) Loved the cute streets! [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1207.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1207.jpg) Then we visited the beautiful Kodaiji Temple. It was small and peaceful. It also had a nice variety of things to see such as a zen garden and a bamboo grove.

Gion is famous in Kyoto and is where people come to try and get a glimpse of a geisha in the early evening. The main Street in Gion was not that long. We wished that cars weren't allowed down the street. They spoiled the atmosphere. As did annoying professional photographers who tried to take photos of girls dressed in kimonos (many girls hired kimonos and had their hair done in a simple style. We saw this being advertised for around ¥3,000 (about $40nzd)).  [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1230.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_1230.jpg) After Gion we had a look around Nishiki Market. There was a variety of food, clothes, and souvenirs to buy or look at. Tried a green tea icecream with green tea kit kat. I can now officially say, after trying green tea several times here...that I don't like it. Good thing Jase does.

The server also appeared to be the chef. We prefer Curry Pot in Newtown better though. Okay time for bed, goodnight! P.s. Many thanks to Jase who endured a lot of shopping today! -Kimmie
