Ohay≈ç gozaimas (good morning)! We got going at 6.30am this morning because we needed to get the train from Ueno to Tokyo in order to then catch our Shinkansen (bullet train). The morning started off a bit stressful because somehow we got a bit lost around Ueno station, and then even more lost when we were at Tokyo station! At Tokyo station we needed to hand in our "exchange order" to receive and activate our Japan Rail (JR) pass. We were expecting the maps to indicate were we might find the counters to do this. After walking around a while we ended up asking an attendant. They helpfully pointed us in the right direction. It was a relief to finally get to this counter. We filled in some forms, the gentleman booked some trains for us, and we were given instructions on how to use the pass. The main thing to know is: don't lose the pass!!! You also need to go through the manned gates and not the usual barriers. The below picture is of Jase finally at the right area of the huge station.¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0902.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0902.jpg) Eventually we made it to our train platform. Jase was excited about buying ekiben (a lunch box of food). Luckily, they had English descriptions. We got a "ginger pork and minced meat cutlets" one and another with salmon and rice wrapped in bamboo leaf. ¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0903.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0903.jpg)¬†¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0924.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0924.jpg)¬†We watched the cleaning teams with interest as they swept through the Shinkansens when they arrived at platforms. In addition to cleaning they flipped all of the chairs around the other way. Jase was keen to get a photo in front of the Shinkansen. I think it had hit some animal because there was an icky looking stain on the train's tip. üòê [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0907.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0907.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0909.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0909.jpg)¬†Since we've been here we've also heard/read about a few "passenger injury" announcements... üòï When we finally got on the Shinkansen we noticed that there was lots of leg room, tray tables, and coat hooks. There were also charging ports on each row and a smoking room between carriages. ¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0912.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0912.jpg)¬†¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0914.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0914.jpg)¬†¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0921.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0921.jpg)¬†¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0920.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0920.jpg)¬†The train conductor was very professional looking. He had an immaculate uniform and perfect eyebrows. We liked the smart double-sided stamp that he used on our tickets. We liked the smoothness of the train and the seat's recline option. The view from Tokyo Station to Nagoya Station was urban and industrial, with little pockets of rural rice paddy fields. We passed through many tunnels. So many that they kept impeding camera photos. We had to snap our shots quickly! We were looking out for Mount Fuji. We weren't sure at first what was Mount Fuji, as it was a bit foggy. So I have some pictures of random mountain ranges. We were lucky to be able to see part of Mount Fuji when we eventually passed it. From the amount of fog today I am sure there would be times the mountain would be hidden. Jase said that it is a shy mountain. üòä¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0918.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0918.jpg) \[wpvideo 0N8lX09t\] The trip to Nagoya was 2 hours. When we arrived we managed to find the platform for our transfer much faster than we did in Tokyo Station. The "Hida wide view express" to Takayama was much smaller, but still had great facilities including foot rests! The scenery on this route was very nice. Lots of green landscapes, rivers, and dams. We love all of the cute traditional houses. ¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0922.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0922.jpg) [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0925.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0925.jpg)¬†**Random observation**: At one of the train stops it looked liked the sign said no fish or snakes on the train...? It was raining when we got to Takayama. Luckily we had an umbrella. It was about a 20 minute walk to our ryokan. We were exited to stay in a ryokan, which is a traditional samurai hotel.¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0927.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0927.jpg) Our ryokan is very cute. It has lots of ornamental displays, onsen (traditional hot pools), an eating room, a variety of slippers, a courtyard, and many other interesting things. Everybody walks around in yakuta (kind of like traditional dressing gowns) and we sleep on traditional tatami mats. The first thing we did was have some green tea on our traditional low table and chairs (on the ground). The green tea in Japan doesn't appear to be very similar to what we have in New Zealand. It has more of a seaweed smell and Jase thinks it has a milkier taste. Alongside the tea we tried the provided sweet. It was in the shape of the town's mascot. [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0926.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0926.jpg) After that we grabbed some of the provided purple umbrellas for a spot of shopping. We thought the shopping here was better than in Tokyo. Lots of things I wanted to buy. We tried a hide beef bun and bought a few things such as sake, apple wine, and plum wine. We changed into our yakuta for dinner. I think yakuta suit Jase. Agree? (see below) Okay. By now you've probably noticed that we like food. We like trying all types of food. Maybe we should just be food bloggers? Let's talk about the amazing kaiseki ryori meal we had for dinner. If this was the kind of meal a samurai used to have, they ate well. ¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0943-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0943-0.jpg)¬†¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0939-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0939-0.jpg)¬†[![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0945-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0945-0.jpg)¬†You can see in the photos nearly all of the 12 courses. There were so many flavours - we estimate around 40. There were also plenty of textures. From sweet to saltly, from firm to slimy. Most of the food we could recognise but some will remain a mystery. Some of the highlights: Hida beef (melt in your mouth, buttery beef), sweet and sour prawns with sesame seeds, sashimi (tuna, prawn, mystery white fleshed fish), pan fried salmon and tempura battered mushrooms, prawn, fish, green leafy thing (_Jase's_ _description_: "what you'd imagine a tempura leaf would taste like") served with green tea salt. Also: I actually liked the _**onion**_ vegetable soup. The dessert was light and fresh, and acted like a ¬†palate cleanser. When we got back from dinner our beds were all made up. Lying on them is heaven. Would describe it like soft marshmallow clouds. Okay. If we can get ourself off this wonderful bed maybe we'll try the onsen. -Kimmie
