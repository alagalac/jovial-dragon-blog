Konichiwa! I tried to post this last night but everything froze on me. I think I overloaded the blog with pics... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We slept well after our long flight yesterday. However, that didn't mean we slept in! We were keen to get out and explore even though most shops don't open until 10am. Instead of shopping we started the day at a nearby coffee store, grabbed some breakfast at a local Family Mart, and then went for a stroll around Ueno park. The iced coffees were pretty good. Nice and refreshing. This is where I first started to notice the use of trays. When you pay for things you are encouraged to put your money in a tray. Our coffees also came out on a tray... Our breakfast from Family Mart was also pretty yummy (triangle filled rice...called onigari). We ate these in the peaceful surroundings of Ueno park. Peaceful depending on your interpretation of peaceful I guess, as it is home to very loud crows and cicadas! They were both a bit intimidating to be honest, and freakishly oversized. The park itself is a bit of an interesting mix of things. It has a zoo and a small theme park of some kind, cafes, monuments....it's also a popular place for dogs it seems! (speaking of dogs, we saw the cutest Japanese shibe inu!!) Once we had relaxed and learnt the 3-step method to opening our onigari (quite ingenious), it was off to Ueno station! We learnt how to get a suica card and load it with yen. We also learnt how to use the card barriers (took a little trial and error!) and then we even figured out the correct train platform (small accomplishments!). ðŸ˜€ **Interesting** **observation**: the escalators had a passing lane, a warning about "upskirting" (Jase has to explain this to me as I was quite oblivious), and had flat as well as up and down sections. We decided not to get on the first train that came because it was peak time and it was packed full of "salary men". The next train came a few minutes later (the frequency of trains is so wonderful!) and our destination was only 2 stops (and funny enough 2 minutes) away. We were excited to finally be in Akihabara, known by many names including "electric town". Nothing much was open yet (except the 24/7 convenience stores and other food places) but we managed to find a few arcade games to play (Jason did not have good luck on the Pokemon game that he was keen on) and some expensive "duty free" stores. We looked in numerous electronic, anime, manga, and cosplay stores when they were open. They all started to blur into one after a while. Not to mention: loud noises!!!! There is music coming for every direction and it's so disorienting... We tried panchinko. It's a game with these little metals balls. We didn't really know what we were doing... but luckily no matter how badly you do you get to exchange your prize balls at a counter. We got some interesting sweets to try. We went to a well-known maid cafe for lunch (@home). Very cutesy. Loved the songs and magic spells to make my food "more delicious". Jase requested a penguin on top of his drink.

We chose our preferred headgear and then posed in one of about four specific "kawaii" poses. Â Â [![](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0863-0.jpg)](https://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0863-0.jpg) After that we got special loyalty cards (in this cafÃ© girl customers are princesses and guys are masters). This cafe obviously wasn't unusual enough for us because we then decided to (after some shopping and gachapon) visit an owl cafe. A very interesting atmosphere. Music such as "my heart will go on", and Christmas music, alongside a fake rainforest, fish tanks, and a line of jim beam bottles.

Here's some owl pictures.... After the owl cafe we found a cute ramen place. Yum. Could not finish it all though!

We decided to hang with the locals at a club called Dear Stage. That was definitely, by far, the most bizarre experience to date. We weren't allowed to take film or pictures unfortunately. A few highlights in their absence :

*   Guys lining up to buy and then trade pics of the girl performers.
*   Guys dancing in the most excited and passionate way I have ever seen. Not sure their enthusiasm and ability to dance along in sync could ever be out-done!!
*   Those awkward moments where we can't communicate..... We were one of only 2 groups of foreigners.
*   The girls that sung had great voices!!

We didn't know how long the intermissions were so spent a lot of time just people watching. After that we went and explored the nightlife of Ueno, before finally making it back to our hotel! Phew!! Night! Kimmie
