We didn't really have much planned for today. The weather was a bit drizzly, so it wasn't great for the outdoor activities we'd like to do. Instead Kimmie found the address of a local cat cafe online. After a bit of a hike, we made it to the cafe. One oddity about Japan is that many stores, cafes, restaurants etc are stuck a couple of stories up a nondescript building. To access them you generally need to use a skungy old elevator with carpet on the wall. And there's no signage. This was one such place! The cafe itself had a very strong cat stink. They had about a dozen cats, which were apparently rescued strays. They had a very odd way of patting the cats, which essentially amounted to whacking them on the backside. Apparently the cats enjoyed it?

It's not the kind of museum you'd expect so we decided to take a look.

Most of them were welded together from glass and metal. At one stage they turned off all the lights and we watched a Kaleidascope show projected onto the walls. Next up we decided to head over to Nijo castle, one of Kyoto's many world heritage sites. It wasn't really so much a castle as a palace. It looked much more governmental rather than actually defensible from attackers. The building itself was pretty huge, and had a number of rooms where the shogun met the local lords. The building had some beautiful gold paintings and carvings. Everything was made out of wood, and the floor creaked as we walked around.

Seriously, there's temples for Africa in Kyoto.

Kimmie touched on Kyoto station in one of her posts, but Kyoto station is pretty amazing. It has a good 12 stories of shops spread across about 4 malls in the station itself, joining on to a couple of adjacent mega malls. All up there's probably more stores in this one complex than all of Wellington. After a long hunt we ended up settling on a tonkatsu (fried pork) restaurant which was pretty good. Curiously you get to grind your own sesame seeds for seasoning.
