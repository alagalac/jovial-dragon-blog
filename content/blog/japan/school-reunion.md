After work today we got home and did a few last minute things. I was fairly relaxed but Jase was encouraging me to hurry along (strange, usually it's the other way around?).

We then went out to grab some food. I was originally thinking Burger Fuel but Jase was worried that would take too long. So we got Tommy Millions pizza slices instead.

All this rushing only to get to the airport with quite a lot of time to spare. We entertained ourselves by wandering the exciting shops on offer at Wellington airport for about 2 hours...

Finally it was time to board the flight. We found our seats in row 15, and then the craziest thing happened. Annabel, a girl who went to the same high school as me (same year group), was sitting next to us! What a coincidence.

I had not seen Annabel since 2008, so it was amazing to be able to catch up. While Annabel jokingly remarked that it was a "forced reunion" due to the seating arrangements, it was a very welcome one. ðŸ˜Š

We talked the whole way from Wellington to Auckland (probably to the annoyance of everyone around us wanting to have a nap). Then when we arrived in Auckland she very kindly offered to give us a lift to our accomodation.

Okay. Time for bed. Got to get up at some insanely early hour. Night.
