Yesterday we went to visit the fort at Bikaner. It'd been built up over many years by many different Raj so there was a huge amount of variation in the architecture. We saw the royal bedroom. The bed was deliberately low to the ground so that enemies couldn't hide under it. Many of the rooms were fantastically painted. The old raj really liked their art. Most of the ceilings were pretty. A few were painted with real gold. It was somewhat creepy the number of people staring and taking pictures of the girls in our group while we were walking around. Our guide made a sexist joke about how a man owns the fort, but then the fort owns a woman. Went down like a lead balloon! Afterwards we were starving, so went for some lunch. I had a tikka masala, but with cottage cheese instead of chicken. Tasted really good. Better than the chicken version, I'd say. Next we set off for the rat temple. The taxi I was in decoded to take a "shortcut". We ended up lost down the back streets of Bikaner and had to ask for directions. Eventually we got there. The temple itself was amazing. Nowhere in the world would you ever see such a sight again. The rats are considered as family members. The one rule is that you can't scream or shout because it will disturb people meditating. They have around 20,000 of them living at the temple. There were large bowls of yoghurt and water for them. I kinda regret that I didn't buy some rat food for them. We managed to catch sight of a rare albino rat. It's good luck if you see it. If you manage to touch it then it'll grant you whatever wish your heart truly desires. Once we got back outside I had a brief chat with a local on his way to his daily prayer at the rat temple. He was really into his cricket, and was a fan of sir Richard Hadlee. After the rat temple we returned to the hotel for a buffet dinner which we weren't really hungry for. We had to eat though as we wouldn't be getting a proper breakfast. We decided to have a few beers at the hotel "bar" before heading off to bed. It was really cool. It was a small room filled with relics from India's colonial past. Lots of swords and daggers lying around. There was also a suit of chain mail hanging up. I was tempted to put it on. Above the bar were a score of pirate rum bottles. There was another early start this morning. We needed to get to the station early since we were catching a public train. There's no assigned seating so we needed to get there early to avoid the dodgy Indian men. The train is called the sand train because it goes through the desert and none of the windows shut properly. I didn't end up getting any sand over me. Maybe you would if it's more windy. The train was stopped quite a bit to let others past. We caused a bit or a stir on the train. One boy in a white shirt sat next to G and stroked her leg. Luckily he got off fairly early. Another one spoke good English and was quite a joker. He sang us a few songs, and did their national anthem. A few of the girls sang god save the queen back at him. He also showed us some of his yoga moves. He stood on his head for us. Liana then did a yoga move too and really brought all of the Indian men to attention! Next was Ricky. He was very friendly, but didn't speak much English. He was very curious about us. The girls got a bit annoyed when he touched their feet or tried to look at what was on their phones. He sat next to me and we held hands. It's pretty normal for straight men to do so in india. You see it on the streets quite a bit.
