We got up again at 5am to climb a local hill and watch the sunrise. It was pretty tall and there were lots of steps. Up the top there was a bunch of hippies smoking weed and dancing to electronic music. There was a temple up the top, but we didn't bother going inside. Behind the temple there were lots of rocks which we climbed to watch the sunrise. Ricky called over a troop of monkeys and then it was all on! I fed the monkeys some of my biscuits, and a few of then surrounded me. One tried grabbing at my jersey. Another monkey jumped on top of Javier's head he had a hat on and so didn't notice initially. The girls all screamed at the sight of the monkeys. We scrambled back to the temple for sanctuary from the monkeys. A couple of monkeys jumped upon Ricky. G wanted a picture with a monkey on her head, but quickly gave up when the monkey started following her. We hoofed it back down the hill with the monkeys still chasing after us. For breakfast we went to a lakeside restaurant. There were lots of flies. Ricky said it means that it'll be a really hot summer in 10 days time. Next we went to authentic yoga lessons. That we pretty fun. He taught us handstands, some sunrise patterns, and the cat tiger cow pattern. Afterwards we hit the markets. There's lots of stuff to buy, but most if it is just junk, and it's a hassle going through everything. I did end up buying a few things though. It was a long walk back to the hotel. We had one of our previous tuktuk drivers following us offering us a ride. We just wanted to walk! For dinner we went to the roof of another local hotel. This hotel was much nicer than the one we were staying at. All of the walls were hand painted with Indian art, and there were plants and vines everywhere throughout the hotel. On the rooftop we ate curry while watching a Bollywood film. The curry was good, although I'm starting to get sick of always eating curry for breakfast lunch and tea.
