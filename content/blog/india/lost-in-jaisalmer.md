Yesterday we arrived in Jaisalmer. It's hot here. Luckily the hotel has a pool we can dip our feet in. We went on an initial orientation walk, and then visited the lake. The girls went on a boat ride while we stayed on the shore. It was really peaceful. I met a guy called Saword who was an airforce engineer. He was really interested about NZ. His wife was there too, hurrying him up. Then I went over to sit next to our guide Ricky and feed the catfish. There were a lot I them and they were really big. It was funny heating them swimming with their whiskers poking above the surface. Afterwards we went to a rooftop restaurant in an Indian mansion. It was originally built for the son of the king. It was really amazing. There were views of the whole city. I ordered a whole tandoori chicken. It was really good! In the morning we left out hotel with a local guide. He showed us about the fort. The fort is one of the few left which still have people living in them. There were lots of street vendors inside. There were some amazing views of she city from on top of the bastions. Next the guide decide to take us to his mate's house and get us to buy their expensive rugs. Apparently we were supposed to spend an hour there, but we decided to hoof it. We all split up and traveled around the market. I went with the Argentinean group and we got a bit lost trying to find the market. I managed to buy a camel shirt, and offend a brass salesman with my low offers. We bumped into some of the girls and then went to an Italian for lunch. Later we got back to the hotel and played volleyball in the pool. For dinner we went to another mansion. This time it had rooftop views of the whole fort, which is lit up at night. On the way back, Brenda insisted on driving the tuktuk. I had my heart in my mouth the whole journey!
