It was another early start. I've been getting used to those as of late. This time it was a train to Agra. The train which we caught was actually a nice one. We had reclining seats, and breakfast was included in our tickets. Ricky ordered some toast and an odd vegetarian sausage for our breakfasts. It wasn't too bad.

We arrived at Agra and made our way to the hotel via auto-rickshaw. We had four hours to freshen up until we went to the Taj Mahal. I went next door to Costa to enjoy a coffee.

The hotel in Agra was a pain because it didn't include free wifi. Everybody was a bit disappointed by it because it was a step down compared to the luxurious hotels we'd been staying at in Rajasthan.

At the gates to the Taj Mahal there were a lot of sellers pestering you to buy postcards and mini statues. We took a transfer vehicle past them. At the main entry gate there were huge queues. However since we had high value foreigner tickets we were able to jump straight past them.

To get into the complex itself we had to go through a metal detector and get a pat down. There were a few army personnel there which guns which meant business. They are very strict about what you can take into the complex. You're only allowed one bottle of water, a camera, and a phone. No food, signs, or anything which could possibly be thrown out as rubbish.

As you'd expect the complex itself was super busy. It was also swelteringly hot! We followed the masses and grabbed some pictures on the lady Diana seat. You had to be really pushy, and not leave the seat until the next person was sitting with you. Otherwise the other people would steal it.

Next we went up to the actual monument itself. Again there were some large queues which we were able to skip. We had to put covers over our feet for walking on the marble.

Close up the Taj Mahal is huge. The whole structure is built of white marble and every surface is exquisitely carved with flowers, and inlaid with gemstones. The whole complex is perfectly symmetrical, down to the walls, and the buildings to either wide of the Taj Mahal. Even the pavement around the complex has lots of unusual geometric patterns.

We were ushered through the main tomb where there were two coffins both inlaid with lots of gems. You couldn't really get too good a look at them though.

We then ended up next to the towers. We sat in the shade of one for about half an hour until the army moved us along. A few Indians took photos of us which was annoying.

Next we split up. I ended up visiting one of the side buildings with Katie and Abby. It was made out of red stone rather than marble, but it still had the same carving as the main Taj Mahal.

We then went walking through the gardens around the sides of the complex. There wasn't anybody there, and it was surprisingly peaceful. There we lots of squirrels and monkeys playing with the Taj Mahal in the background.

Afterwards we left for a different hotel for dinner. While we were eating dinner a few people started celebrating Holi early, which we weren't impressed about. I got a beer spilt over me, and some of the girls got paint on their pashminas.

The next morning we had a late start. Ricky bought us a whole load of paint and we went back to the hotel we had dinner at the night before.

At the hotel there were drums which people danced to. We threw lots of powered paint at one another, and all became very colourful. Some of the older men were mixing their paint with water and smearing it on our faces. I ended up with a black face.

With a German group we left the hotel to go to the house of some taxi driver. On his roof there was lots of paint and lots of water. We were all completely drenched with water and dye.

After a while some of us went back to the hotel for food and to dry off. The paints which we'd bought were natural ones which come out in water, but the paints that other people were throwing at us weren't. They didn't really come out except with a lot of hard scrubbing. Most of the girls had a new hair colour.

We took a tuktuk to KFC for lunch. Along the way somebody threw yellow paint at us, messing up the fresh clothes Liana, Tara, and Maize had on. The KFC was closed until five anyway, so we ended up turning around and going to the Pizza Hut next to the hotel. This was my second time there in as many days.

For the next few hours we ventured out for a bit and did some shopping. By now the paint had subsided a bit. For dinner we ended up going back to KFC.

Nothing else was open except for Pizza Hut!
