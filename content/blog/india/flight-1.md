Some pretty cool views of the Makara wind turbines on my way over. It was a pretty good flight. The food was decent. I ended up watching the movie Gravity because I felt like watching a disaster movie about flying above the earth while I was flying above the earth. Best part was the landing. There was a gull with its wings up saying "come at me bro" to the plane. One issue with Sydney airport. They require your age, gender, and address to access the wifi. What is this?
