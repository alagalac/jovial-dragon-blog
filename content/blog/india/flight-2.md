Forgot to mention in the previous post that Air New Zealand ID'd me for alcohol on the flight. Must be my baby face. It's a real pain digging around for you passport while your tray table is full. Before boarding the flight I was paged by the ground crew and quizzed over my visa. I thought I was late for the flight and ended up chucking out my yummy pasta salad which made up dinner #2 :-/ The good: - Metal cutlery - After hours of dry recycled air, orange juice tastes like golden nectar of the gods. Baileys with dessert is great as well. - Finally got around to watching Thor 2. Was an alright movie. - The pilot addressed everybody as "Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls". For some reason this is funny at 5am NZT. - The still give you free toothbrushes and toothpaste. - Getting a dinner #3. The bad: - A district lack of sports illustrated models in the safety video. - People with colds sitting near me. Hope I don't catch anything. - Forced to watch all movies with Chinese subtitles. Also very easy to get the wrong language. - Getting a dinner #3. The ugly: - Frozen peanuts? - Still not sure what meal I ate at between 11pm and 4am depending on your time zone. Have they invented a new spicy noodle midnight snack? - They still give you free airline socks :S - Investigation pending into what the milk they give you with every meal is for. One final note. Landing in Singapore at night with the lights off is pretty stunning. The whole bay is filled with ships lit up light Christmas trees. One second final note. Changi airport is huge. I had to catch the skyway.
