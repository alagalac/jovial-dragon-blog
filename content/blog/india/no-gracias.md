So I've now met the rest of my group. There's a bit of a mix. Lots of people from the UK. We decided to go on a bit of an adventure outside. Lots of dust. So much dust. My eyes were watering. Also lots of stall, all mostly selling the same stuff. Finally there were lots of beggars and sales people. If you say "No thank you" they keep pestering you. What we've found is if you say "No gracias" they assume you don't speak English and leave you alone. Genius! It's my new catch phrase. Due to the fun design of the bathroom in my room, it floods whenever you use the shower. Curiously there's also a bath tap but no bath. At first I assumed that the hot water didn't work and so had a cold shower. Turns out that it just takes about 10 minutes for the hot water to start coming through. At least I warmed the shower up for Scott.
