Blogs. They're the in thing these days. Nuff said. With any luck this blog will be a vehicle to chronicle my adventures and whatever happens in between. Or I'll get lazy and the last thing you'll know is I am lost in a jungle. Never to be heard from again. Lately I'm been doing much planning for my upcoming trip to India. Booking travel insurance isn't very fun. I do however have a list of much less fun things:

1.  Getting vaccinated (Ouch).
2.  Paying for vaccinations (Double ouch).
3.  Shopping for a backpack. (Thanks mum!)
4.  Awkwardly asking for gastro stuff at the pharmacy.

At least I managed to save a bit of money on the polio vaccination. India hasn't had a case in nearly three years and is about to be declared polio free by the WHO. However since the WHO declaration is still a few months away they are still obliged to recommend it to me. Yay for reading the news. If anybody is interested in the itinerary then it can be viewed [here](http://www.gadventures.com/trips/india-on-a-shoestring/AHRH/2014/itinerary/ "India on a Shoestring Itinerary"). You can see a pretty map of where I'm going [here](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zGNBlw-d5_y4.kZRxfKWTc6NA "Google Maps Itinerary").
