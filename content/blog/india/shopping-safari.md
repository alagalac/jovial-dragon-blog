At 5am we caught the public bus to Jodhpur. The bus ride was alright, except for the horn on the bus. They used it frequently, and there were about half a dozen different sounds, each more ridiculous than the last. There didn't seem to be a pattern determining their usage. Nobody got much sleep. We arrived at the polo heritage hotel. This place is really nice. Another swimming pool, and the bathrooms are more like bathrooms. We freshened up, and then hit the town. We spent 40 mins about the market square. I managed to get a couple of things. We went into a lassi house for delicious lassi's. Not sure what flavour they were, but they had a few Indian spices. Next we went to an apparently famous spice shop. We had a spiel about all the different spices and were offered tea. I ended up getting some curry spices. Afterwards we left to go on a village safari. We all got out at the first house and sat down. Some kind of village elder then started preparing an opium drink. At this point we all looked at each other. A bit unsure. I didn't end up trying any, but apparently it tasted just like dirty water. We then continued onwards. With the guide pointing out wild peacocks and deer. We arrived at a small village where they showed us how they make the pottery and the block art. We ended up buying a few more souvenirs. For dinner we then to a thali restaurant. It was all you can eat and they kept bringing out a huge array of vegetarian food. Tomorrow we have an right our bus to Jaipur. Not looking forward to it.
