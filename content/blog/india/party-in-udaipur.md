The bus drive was really long. There wasn't enough music on my phone, so I kept listening to the same albums on repeat. We had a break at an Indian bus stop. It felt like our tour bought half the store. I got some full toss snacks which were pretty good. After we arrived at our hotel we went on an orientation walk. We went to the miniature painting place where they taught us how they make the paintings that Udaipur is famous for. They painted a nail for each of us. I got a picture of an India prince on mine. They miniature paintings that they were selling seemed expensive. I think I can get a better deal in the city. Before dinner we went to a traditional Rajasthan dance show. They were really good. They were swinging around lots of bells. Then there was a man with a couple of puppets. One of them was able to juggle its head. Another ate some string, and some kids from the audience had to pull it out. One lady was dancing with up to nine pots balanced on her head. For dinner we went to the whistling swan. I ate Jungli Maas which is a traditional goat curry. They goat tasted weird. It was kinda fatty. We were going to have hooka, but apparently it's banned at the moment because the Indian elections are coming up. After dinner we went back to the hotel for a rooftop party with two other tour groups. We had a dance off, and I ended up jumping in the swimming pool with my clothes on.
