Yesterday evening we went out to another restaurant recommended by Ricky, our guide. It turned out to be a bit of a case of déjà Vu. The menu was identical to that which we went to the night previously. I'm sure that the two places are just for tourists. You'd never expect to see butter chicken on the menu of a real indian restaurant. I ended up ordering a biryani with a long name. It tasted alright. However I ordered a salt lassi to go with it. I should have gone with the mango one. The biryani also came with yoghurt. Afterwards I was feeling a bit sick of salted yoghurt. At 11 we left out hotel to go to the train station. G's bag was too big so it had to go on the roof of our taxi. It wasn't secured to I had to stick my arm out the window and hold it in place. The train ride itself was pretty hilarious. There were 8 beds to a section, stacked three, three, then two. The bunks above ground were held in place by chains from the roof. I was on the top bunk. A few of the girls were freaking out because there were some tiny cockroaches, and stains on the sheets. I was glad for the sleeping bag liner! Above all it was pretty hilarious. The Indian couple who were also in our booth were chuckling to themselves. I managed to get a few good hours if sleep. In the morning it turned out that one of the girls lost her jandle down the loo onto the tracks. Not getting that back. Next we caught some taxis through Bikaner. There were lots of cows just sleeping on the road. Our hotel this time is made out of red or pink stone. It has a pool! But there's no water in it. The hotel was made 300 years ago as a residence for some of the Indian nobles. There are so many doves cooing that it sounds like the UK. We leave at 11 for the camel ride and camp in the desert.
