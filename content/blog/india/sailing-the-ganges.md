The day before yesterday we caught a sleeper train. It was 13 hours from Agra to Varanasi. We had to get locks and chains for our bags on this one because apparently baggage thefts happen. Apparently the theives throw your luggage off the train for their accomplices
to pick up. The ride itself was fairly uneventful. I slept listening to music.

Our new hotel in Varanasi is nice. It seems to be the only nice thing in the city though. Varanasi seems to be much poorer than the other cities we visited. It doesn't have any of the nice buildings that the Rajasthan cities had. There's also fewer cars and more people on the streets.

A couple of people ventured outside while I stayed inside reading. They weren't able to find any markets, and became lost since nobody knew where our hotel was. They were lucky to make it back!

Later we took tricycle rickshaws to the ghats and caught a boat on the river. It took ages for the driver for the boat to arrive. There were lots of insects trying to bite us while we waited.

We sailed out into the middle and were each given a little boat containing flowers and a candle. We lit these and let them go into the river. It was to honour our ancestors.

After that we sailed over to an evening ceremony. Lots of people on the shore, and lots of boats all crowded around to watch. I wasn't really sure what was going on, but there were five guys burning incense and moving in time to some music.

The next morning was were up early again. This time for a sunrise over the Ganges. We hopped on a boat again and sailed back into the middle of the river. The sunrise was really good. The we sailed back closer to shore and watched what the locals were up to. There were people bathing, doing their washing, and burning fires. We saw a wrapped up child's body floating next to one of the other boats.

Ricky and some of the others jumped into the river. Yesterday Ricky was telling us how it's one of the cleanest rivers in the world because of it's own special bacteria. I wasn't inclined to believe him. I don't think you could pay me enough to jump in that river!

We rode tuktuks back to the hotel and had French toast for breakfast.
