Today we got up bright and early for a day trip around Delhi. We took the metro which was very busy. It's was kinda funny how the front carriage was always reserved for women. We travelled around some of the oldest streets in Delhi to get to the largest mosque in Asia. Jama Masjid was the name. It was pretty impressive. Then we went to a Shik temple where they fed, sang to, and put to bed at night. We weren't allowed to take pictures of the main shrine, but the book was in a sort of solid gold shrine, covered with cloths and flowers. There were people playing instruments and constantly singing. Apparently they do that because people would get bored if they just read the incantations. We then went into the temple kitchen and helped them cook lunch. It was all free on the condition that you finished everything on your plate. It was really good. It was funny because we were taking photos of the Indians, while at the same time they were taking photos back. One guy asked to have a photo with me. After we walked back through some of the old alleyways. The traffic was still crazy. It kinda felt like this was what the streets were like in NZ or the UK a few hundred years ago, except with motorbikes and rikshaws instead of horses and carriages. There were quite a few fireworks shops. There's no restrictions on them so people set them off whenever they're in the mood. I heard some last night.
