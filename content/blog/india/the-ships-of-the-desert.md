Yesterday we left the hotel in these small mini vans. I was seated at the back. No seatbelts, no windows. Ricky put on some pumping Bollywood music so we were singing and dancing on our ride through the streets.

The Indian roads are interesting. There are two road rules:

1. Drive on the left.
2. Give way to cows.

The first isn't strictly adhered to.

We arrived at a smallish village where we met our camels. We each got to pick our camel. I think I got a pretty good one. It didn't misbehave. One of the others was constantly frothing at the mouth and sticking out its stomach or something.

We road for about an hour. We could see that they've started irrigating quite a bit of the desert to grow wheat so it was surprisingly green.

We finally stopped for lunch an had a meal in the shade. After lunch we carried on for two more hours. We went down the main road of a small village. By main road I mean dirt track, but it was interesting to just look at the places where the people lived.

Riding on the camel back I could almost imagine what it was like for the early traders. It was pretty peaceful. We saw a few antelope and desert foxes. Apparently there were once lions living there, but they were hunted to extinction.

We arrived at our camp and then climbed a sand dune to watch the sunset. The sun didn't so much as set as fade away on the horizon. After dark we had a bonfire and partied until the small hours.

We slept in a row of tents. They weren't too cold. Our cooks just slept under the stars. To be honest I'd have liked to have done that too.

We woke up early to Masala tea. After a quick breakfast of not really toasted bread, omelette (they seem to serve this everywhere), and bananas we road some camel carts back to our taxis to return to our hotel.
