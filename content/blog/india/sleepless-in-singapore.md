The last Saturday of my trip was a fairly slow day. I got to bed at 5 in the morning. Ricky said we'd all meet for breakfast at 9 so I got up still feeling tired. Ricky didn't get up until about 12. Figures. Throughout the day we had a stream if people leaving and lots of goodbyes. I went out for a bit of shopping with Tara and Sophia, just so that I could say I did something. At 7 Sophia and I caught a taxi over to the airport. Security is surprisingly tight at the Delhi airport. Lots of army personnel with big guns. Thy check your passport and luggage all along the way. Lots of checks that I've never seen at another airport before including all carry on baggage must have a tag stamped by a security office. I bought a bottle of rum and a bottle of lemongrass vodka to share back home. The flight to Singapore was fairly uneventful, primarily because I was really sleepy. God knows why they serve dinner on a flight after midnight. They ran out of the western style dinner so I ended up with an odd Indian one. I didn't know what half the stuff was and it didn't taste great. At Changi airport I booked a free tour of Singapore. That was fun. We took a bus through the city and had a brief stop by the Merlion. It was really hot! Back at the airport I made my way through the terminals, visiting the orchid, cactus, bamboo, butterfly, and sunflower gardens. They're really pretty. I also spent time at the movie theatre watching the fantastic four. I noticed that the duty free stores have special instructions for people going to Australia. After a few enquiries it became apparent that you can only take carry on alcohol to Australia if it was purchased at the airport you're flying from. Bugger. I could have checked in my alcohol, but to do that I'd need to clear Singapore's customs which only allow one bottle and then re check in. In the ended I had to ditch the alcohol. I opted to open it up and at least enjoy some of it. The result was my most expensive rum and coke ever.
