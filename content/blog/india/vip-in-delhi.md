After dinner some of Liana's Indian friends arrived in Mercedes cars to pick us up. We drove to the beat club in Delhi. Entry was 2000 rupees, but Mack knew the owner so we got in for free.

The club was lush. There was a large indoors section, and then a really nice garden area. Mack bought us champagne and vodka. The drinks cost about the same as drinks in Wellington, which by Indian standards is exorbitant.

The club was surprisingly empty because the Pakistan vs India cricket was on. Later in the night we moved in to the VIP lounge.

The VIP lounge was really nice. There was a huge area surrounded by small mirrors which gave of a sparkly effect. The toilets were a bit creepy because there was a man there watching you pee. He'd then turn on and off the taps for you to wash your hands, and offer you paper towels.

After a while we left to go and get some food at another posh hotel. The food was delicious. At the risk of mentioning toilets twice in one blog post, I'd have to say that the urinals at this hotel were the best I've ever seen. You had your own privately decorated area, with soft carpet underfoot. Then there were lovely warm heat lamps directed at you while you pee. We need toilets like this in Wellington!

The drive back was an experience. One of Mack's cousins was driving. We were doing about 160 down the highway in a 50 zone. Red lights weren't an issue either, although at that time of night nobody obeys red lights. The Delhi police had a tendency to leave barriers in the road to force cars to slow down, but we swerved around those at speed throwing all of us in the back around.
