The day after the party we got up at 10 am. Still too early! We made it to a bakery for breakfast. I had a pizza and it tasted really good. Afterwards we went on a boat ride on the lake. We circled the lake palace, and saw the place which the Taj Mahal was modeled after. Apparently you can hire out the island for weddings. It costs around $150k. Angelina Jolie an Brad Pitt got married there. When the boat ride was over it was back to the hotel. I spent most of the morning blobbing out. I did venture out to buy some fruit from the side of the road. It was funny the way that the guy weighed the fruit with an old fashioned manual scale. In the afternoon I went for a walk through one of the parks in the city. It was quite a nice park. There were also a lot more westerners than the other cities we'd visited. There was a family of monkeys on the side of the path. I made my way through the streets to the Janak crafts center where I did a cooking class for dinner. I helped to make samosas, palak paneer, and a really nice potato and eggplant mix. While we were dining we could see the city palace which was lit up with some kind of light show. The roof of the place had a 360 degrees view of the city. I took some pictures of one I the houses which was crawling with squirrels. After dinner it was back to the hotel for sleep because we had a 5am start for the train. The train became really busy, and I ended up in a booth by myself next to an elderly Indian lady. She had an impressive heena. We transferred to a bus which we took over the mountain pass into Pushkar. Pushkar is one of the two holiest places in India. You aren't allowed to drink alcohol or eat meat, but apparently cannabis is legal. Ricky brought along a bottle of "Pepsi" with us though. There are a lot of westerners here too. Plenty of hippies. The town is centered around a holy lake. It's very religious. We went for a walk to the lake. On the way we ran into a herd of cows on the road and fed them. The lake itself is really peaceful. It's where Ghandi's ashes were scattered. It's surrounded by ghats. We went to one of them and did a flower ceremony to leave our bad karma behind us and get happiness and well being for our friends and families. Later we went to a nice Italian restaurant where we sat on the floor and ate pizza. Lots of hippies in the restaurant smoking weed though. I swear I've never seen so many pizza places in my life as in Pushkar. On our walk back to the tuktuks there were drummers in the street. We stayed to watch. It was a bit boring though since they just kept playing the same beat over and over.
