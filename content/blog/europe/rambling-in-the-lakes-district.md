As our time in the UK was drawing to an end, we decided to take one last domestic holiday up north to the Lakes District. We drove up with our friends on a classic British roadtrip filled with toll roads, traffic jams, car crashes, and dodgy service stations.

Sunset on the lake
------------------

We booked a sunset canoeing trip with mountain memories. Apparently there was a lot of traffic in the evening, and our guide almost had to cancel on us as he was stuck on the other side of the Drewentwater. Luckily he was able to catch a ride over with a local boatie! We were glad that he didn't have to cancel as we had an amazing time on our sunset cruise.

Our guide took us out on his canoes which he built himself. Padding the canoes took a lot of coordination, as they weren't very stable and we didn't want to fall in to the water! While we were padding across the lake our guide told us stories about the local area as we watched the sun set.

Off we go.

We paddled over to one of the islands on the lake where he built a bonfire and we toasted marshmallows and drank hot chocolate.

When it was time to go home we paddled home in the dark silence, with the stars twinkling above.

Hiking the Catbells
-------------------

One morning we got up bright and early to do some "rambling", or hiking. The Catbells is one of the most famous hikes in the Lakes District. It goes up a huge hill near Keswick to overlook Derwentwater.

The climb up.

The hike itself was pretty straight-forward, you just climb up the hill. There were a few points where you had to scramble up rocks though. It was fairly busy, and a few times we had to queue and wait for other people to pass.

We had lunch by the lake on the way back.

Llamas vs Whiskey
-----------------

In our remaining time, the ladies decided to go and check out a nearby llama farm. Meanwhile the boys went to the neighouring whiskey distillery.

We also checked out the Castlerigg stone circle. The was very atmospheric place, and eerie thinking that people moved these huge stones here thousands old years ago.

Finally we just enjoyed walking around the lake.

In conclusion

We're glad that we took the time to visit the Lakes District. It was a beautiful and peaceful escape from the daily rush in London.
