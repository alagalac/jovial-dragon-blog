A few months ago, Kimmie had to apply for her visa (Jase doesn’t need one as he has a British passport). This two-part series is all about her experience. Part one covers her pre-application research and the application form.

Pre-application anxiety
-----------------------

We’d booked our one-way flights to London. The next step was to get my Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) Visa which would allow me to live and work in the U.K. for up to two years. I started by reading, and re-reading, the [official online guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-zealand-apply-for-a-uk-visa/apply-for-a-uk-visa-in-new-zealand), which has actually been updated since I applied a few months ago. At the time of my application (and potentially now) the official website was missing information. It also used phrases that could be interpreted in multiple ways. I also researched the visa process on forums, blogs, and other relevant websites. The information I found was confusing and conflicting. Most of it was posted around 2015 and was out-of-date (if there is one thing I learned, it is that the visa application process  is in a state of constant change!) Feeling unsatisfied, I decided to email the official “UK Visas and Immigration International Enquiry Service” for help. Unfortunately, their response was less than helpful. It was robotic, and the information was a direct copy-and-paste from the official website. Luckily, Jase stumbled upon a news article announcing that Youth Mobility Visa applicants could now apply 6 months in advance of their departure date instead of only 3 months in advance! This was a relief, as it meant I could apply earlier and not have to wait until 3 months out.

The application form
--------------------

The online application form took some time to fill out. I also found it quite stressful. Here are some reasons why:

*   **There were grammatical errors.** Apostrophes were absent and some sentences were missing spaces between the words. It made me twitch… just a little.
*   **The questions were repetitive.** It's like those personality tests that ask you the same thing multiple times but in _slightly_ different ways!
*   **The questions were vague and could be misinterpreted.** All you need to do is type one of these questions into Google and you’ll see that others have sought clarification too!
*   **Some requirements were time-consuming.** For example, I needed to provide information about 10 years’ worth of overseas trips! Smart gate passport processing has reduced the number of stamps in my passport. However, in this instance I was very grateful for the stamps I did have!
*   **Some questions required advanced planning.** For instance, I needed to provide a U.K. address and other contact details. I wonder who initially has this to hand at the visa application stage? You can’t just put any random U.K. address either. The address assigns you a location to pick up your Biometric Residence Permit, which you need to do within 10 days of arriving in the U.K.
*   **The drop-down boxes were odd.** Sometimes they provided one choice “options”. One time it forced me to say that I live in Wellington, _Auckland_, New Zealand!
*   **Some “one size fits all” questions didn’t apply.** For example, it asked for the “place of issue” and the “issuing authority” as stated on my passport. My passport does not have these separately, and it was not immediately obvious that I could put the same answer twice.
*   **There were alarming warning boxes.** They started appearing on each page about halfway through the application process. They warned me not to press any back buttons. They might as well have said: "There is no going back now. Once you pay your fees they are non-refundable. If you've made a mistake you you'll be penalised…"

Have you been through the Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) Visa process? What did you think? Stay tuned for part two, when I cover the biometric appointment, the process of sending off the documents, and my final comments. Kimmie
