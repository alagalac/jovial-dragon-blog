We recently flew from Wellington to London on Singapore Airlines. During the flights, Kimmie keenly observed the airline’s service, food + drink, entertainment, and extra special touches. Read on to see where Singapore Airlines excelled, and where they could improve.

Context
-------

We travelled on one of the fastest routes from Wellington to London (the fastest is with Qatar Airways). We flew on an older Boeing 777 plane from Wellington to Singapore (with a pit stop in Canberra), and switched to a newer Airbus A380 from Singapore to London.  The Wellington to Singapore section was overnight. The Singapore to London section was during the day, and looking out of the window we had good views of India, Pakistan, and Central Asia.

Service
-------

#### The good

*   The flight attendants were very kind and smiled a lot
*   The flight attendants promptly removed all empty cups, completed meal trays, and rubbish
*   The aircrafts were kept clean and tidy
*   The planes were boarded efficiently and to-time

#### The bad

*   Follow-up on our requests was not great. I asked for a few things and were told they would be arranged, but they never were. For example, I asked for an eye mask a few times but I never ended up getting one. It’s a good thing I manged to sleep anyway!

Food + drink
------------

#### The good

*   Overall, the quality of the main meals was okay (the food was better on a Qantas flight we took recently)
*   There was so much food – I felt we were being over fed!
*   The menus were in very cute little booklets
*   It was nice to be provided with metal cutlery
*   There were lots of snacks available between meals (and snacks baskets were freely available for raiding!)
*   Drinks were regularly offered (particularly orange and apple juice!)

#### The bad

*   We’ve probably be spoilt with Air New Zealand, but we didn’t like the fact that the bread buns were cold and a little stale.
*   There appeared to be certain times when we could order alcoholic drinks/cocktails. I asked for a Singapore Sling a few times, but the air hostesses kept telling me that I needed to wait for this service (which did not seem to be offered on the first leg to Singapore…). On the second leg from Singapore I finally got to try one.

Entertainment
-------------

#### The good

*   The entertainment system on the newer plane was good, with the controller under the TV screen (such a relief – see below)! While the movie selection was good, I would have preferred a more recent selection of music to choose from, as most of the albums were from the 80s/90s.
*   USB charging ports were available on the newer plane

#### The bad

*   The entertainment system on the old plane was a bit broken and the video quality was average. Not to mention the controller was annoyingly positioned in the arm rest and I regularly hit it by accident!!
*   The overhead announcements that overrode the entertainment systems were always so much louder, giving me a fright and deafening me

Extra special touches
---------------------

*   A wide range of newspapers and magazines were provided
*   It was nice to be provided with refreshing hot towels before each meal
*   We were given a little pouch with a toothbrush/toothpaste and socks
*   Mouthwash, hand cream, and other amenities were available in the bathroom
*   I liked that there were cup holders. This meant I could have my tray table folded when I only had a drink.
*   There were mirrors on the tray tables of the newer plane, so you could do your makeup in your seat if you wanted to.

I would fly with them again, but they have room for improvement! It will be good when they upgrade their fleet to the newer planes. Kimmie
