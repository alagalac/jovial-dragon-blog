On Sunday we enjoyed wandering around the [Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/en) for several hours. We hope you like pictures. Our photo collection is almost as grand as the Louvre. Just kidding.

Arriving at the Louvre
----------------------

We arrived at the Louvre about 15 minutes before it opened at 9am. Surprisingly, there weren't many people there. We thought everyone would have the same idea as us. Our tickets were pre-purchased with an allocated time slot online, making our entry very straightforward. We were up the front of the line which was good, as the line was very long by the time the museum doors opened. \[caption id="attachment_596" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the first people at the Louvre that day!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve2-600x338.jpg) One of the first people at the Louvre that day!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_597" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase with the upside-down pyramid at the entrance to the Louvre.

Mona Lisa
---------

First things first - when you're at the front of the line you've got to make the most of it. Kimmie made a beeline for the Mona Lisa, her logic being that we wouldn't need to contend with huge crowds if we were first. Jase and our friends thought she was a bit too eager... but it was worth the rush to not have to deal with hordes of people. It was also awesome going through majestic empty hallways. \[caption id="attachment_595" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Rushing to see Mona. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve3-600x338.jpg) Rushing to see Mona.\[/caption\] It was pretty neat to be some of the first people to see her that day. However, we thought that the giant painting opposite Mona was more impressive. It is the largest painting at the Louvre, and is very bright and colorful in comparison with the serious looking Mona! \[caption id="attachment_602" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase is stoked to be with Mona.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve4-600x337.jpg) Jase with Mona.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_601" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The impressive "Wedding at Cana", which is the largest painting in the Louvre.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve5-600x426.jpg) The impressive "Wedding at Cana", which is the largest painting in the Louvre.\[/caption\]

Our plan for the Louvre
-----------------------

In our effort to avoid the Mona crowds, we didn't pick up a map (which annoyingly are only on the ground floor). We couldn't be bothered going back down to get a map, so our exploration of the Louvre ended up being completely unstructured. We just followed our noses. Which was nice, except that we got a little lost and ended up walking in a few circles. We spent most of our time looking at the paintings, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiques, and the Egyptian antiques. We had a little look at the Arts of Africa, Asia, Oceania and Americas, but that section was quite small and a little sad in comparison to everything else.

Paintings
---------

We enjoyed looking at so many stunning paintings. We wondered how long it would have taken to paint each one! Here are a few that caught our eye. \[caption id="attachment_607" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of Kimmie's faves - Le Pandemonium.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve26-600x338.jpg) One of Kimmie's faves - Le Pandemonium.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_608" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A nice scene.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve25-600x337.jpg) A nice scene.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_609" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Grande Odalisque.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve24-600x363.jpg) Grande Odalisque.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_598" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A painting of Joan of Arc.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve8-600x338.jpg) A painting of Joan of Arc.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_599" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Liberty Leading the People painting. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve7-600x351.jpg) Liberty Leading the People painting.\[/caption\] As you can see, it didn't take long before people started to fill the hallways. \[caption id="attachment_610" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The hallway with lots of paintings, and lots more people.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve13-600x338.jpg) The hallway with lots of paintings, and lots more people.\[/caption\]

Statues
-------

The Louvre has quite a big selection of statues. Here are some that got our attention. \[caption id="attachment_613" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A tall statue of Athena.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve14-338x600.jpg) A tall statue of Athena.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_614" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Admirers surround the arm-less Athena statue, in a hall full of Athena statues. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve15-600x337.jpg) A hall full of Venus statues, including Venus de Milo in the background.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_615" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Winged Victory of Samothrace (also called the Nike of Samothrace).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve12-600x338.jpg) Winged Victory of Samothrace (also called the Nike of Samothrace).\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_616" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Nymph with a Scorpion.

The Egyptian section
--------------------

Who doesn't like Egyptian history and artifacts? We thought everything on display in this area was pretty fascinating. Jase was a bit unsure about all the sarcophagi though. \[caption id="attachment_625" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Some Egyptian trinkets. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve16-338x600.jpg) Some Egyptian trinkets.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_620" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![An Egyptian painting. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve21-338x600.jpg) An Egyptian painting.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_619" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A painted sarcophagus.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve22-600x338.jpg) A painted sarcophagus.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_621" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with some Egyptian statues.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve20-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with some Egyptian statues.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_622" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase with a Sphinx statue. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve19-600x450.jpg) Jase with a Sphinx statue.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_623" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Horus as Falcon Egyptian Statue.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve18-600x399.jpg) Horus as Falcon Egyptian Statue.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_624" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Horus Egyptian statue.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve17-600x368.jpg) Horus Egyptian statue.\[/caption\]

The Arts of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas
---------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned above, this section was a little sad. It was lacking in content and energy (and was in a really weird part of the museum that was hard to get to even with a map!). But, we still found some pretty cool pieces. \[caption id="attachment_633" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Like the heads on Easter Island.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve28-338x600.jpg) Like the heads on Easter Island.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_634" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A blue statue.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve27-338x600.jpg) A blue statue.\[/caption\]

Building architecture
---------------------

### Outside

The outside of the Louvre is beautiful. It even has nice manicured lawns with statues. You can see the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The only annoying thing, which you can't see in the below pictures, is the people selling their cheap touristy trinkets. They were set up all along the pathway from the Louvre to the Arc de Triomphe. \[caption id="attachment_630" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Nice grounds outside the Lourve. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve31-600x338.jpg) Nice grounds outside the Louvre.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_631" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The famous pyramid entrance. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve30-600x338.jpg) The famous pyramid entrance.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_629" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Lourve from the side. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve29-600x338.jpg) The Louvre from the side.\[/caption\]

### Inside

If the outside isn't impressive enough for you, we loved the inside of the building. It is covered in magnificent detail - including murals on the ceiling! \[caption id="attachment_600" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Amazing ceiling.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve6-600x338.jpg) Amazing ceiling.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_611" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Another impressive ceiling painting.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lourve9-600x338.jpg) Another impressive ceiling painting.\[/caption\]

Verdict
-------

We spent over 3 hours at the Louvre, and although we aren't artsy people we found it very fascinating. We thought the pieces were very interesting from a historical perspective. So many of them are ancient! The sheer number of pieces to look at was mind boggling. It was hard to take it all in. We wish that we had been able to read the signs next to each of the exhibits as they were all in French! If we had more time to look around the museum (ie several days) we would have liked to purchase the English audio guide so we could learn more about what we were seeing. Even though we were only standing, walking up stairs, and walking around the museum, we found it quite tiring. Probably because it takes so long to get from one end of the museum to the other! All in all we enjoyed the Louvre. More than we expected to actually. Perhaps more museums should be on our to-do lists? Jase and Kimmie
