Prague. A pretty place to wander around. But we decided to also check out the cocktail and alchemy scene!

A classy cocktail crawl
-----------------------

### Hemingway Bar

When Kimmie mentioned to her workmates that she was going to Prague, one of them said that we MUST check out the [Hemingway Bar](http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague/). Kimmie is never one to dismiss a cocktail bar recommendation, so we decided to try it! We didn't make a reservation, and decided to wing it. Luckily, we were cocktailing on a Thursday night and the friendly staff invited us in and directed us upstairs to sit at one of the remaining seats at the bar. The place had a prohibition era feel to it. Dim lighting, and classy music playing softly in the background. The barman chatted to us for a while before taking our order. Jase tried a "Dark Side", which was served in a Darth Vadar mug. Kimmie ordered a drink called "Royale Blue Molecule" that came with a candied blackcurrant sugar angel wing decoration. Both drinks were pretty good, and we could see that the barmen took a lot of care making the them. \[caption id="attachment_1291" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Behind the bar at the Hemingway.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cocktails-behind-bar-600x338.jpg) Behind the bar at the Hemingway.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1292" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Royale Blue Molecule and the Darth Vadar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cocktails-prague-600x398.jpg) The Royale Blue Molecule and the Darth Vadar.\[/caption\] Jase's second drink, "Taste of the Forest", came with its own little mini moss garden. The barman's final touch was a piece of spruce which he picked up and lit on fire, making the air smell of Christmas trees! Kimmie's second cocktail, "Candy Shop", was garnished with a homemade marshmallow and tasted like dessert. \[caption id="attachment_1294" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Taste of the Forest cocktail.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/forest-drink-prague-600x338.jpg) Taste of the Forest cocktail.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1293" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Candy Shop cocktail.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/candy-shop-cocktail-prague-338x600.jpg) Candy Shop cocktail.\[/caption\] The Hemingway Bar has a signature cocktail on its menu with absinthe, called Fairy Ale. We didn't try it but we saw others with it. The drink is served in an interesting large bulb-like container, and you have a tap that you turn on and off to pour the drink into a glass. Looking on their website, it seems as if they pride themselves on their use of this spirit:

> The assortment of absinthe varieties our bar offers is certainly the most extensive in the Czech Republic. We have very rare replicas of the best absinthes ever made. We serve this noble spirit in the traditional way. Guests are very surprised at the general ignorance circulating about absinthe. They have their own ideas about how to drink absinthe, which unfortunately are often very wrong (including setting cheap Czech absinthe substitutes on fire).

The Bar had certain "rules" to obey, which you can [read on their menu](http://www.hemingwaybar.cz/bar-praha/public/docs/list/hemingway-cocktails-2017.pdf). Essentially, they encourage a quiet and respectful atmosphere, and these rules foster the bar's classy, chilled out vibe. We enjoyed ourselves at the Hemingway Bar. We were impressed by the quality of the cocktails and the really friendly service. Some websites have listed it among the top cocktail bars in the world. The drinks were expensive by Czech standards but cheap if compared to London cocktail prices!

### AnonymouS Bar

Next stop was a curiously themed bar which Kimmie had also been recommended. We made a reservation at 9:00pm, which is the last time you can make a reservation (you can stay until the wee hours of the morning if you desire). [Anonymous Bar's](http://www.anonymousbar.cz/en) theme is linked to the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot, which was brought back into focus in the 1980 comic series "V for Vendetta" and 2006 film of the same name. The bar is apparently designed like V for Vendettas hideout. It is also, as the name suggests, linked to the anarchist movement. As their website says:

> Anonymous is anonymous and independent non-hierarchical movement that has become known in the Internet community during the year of 2003 based on the automatically generated alias of contributors to the site 4chan.org and the likes. Information about Anonymous began to make headlines in the medias in 2010 and 2011 due to the high interest generated by their activities associated with hackactivistic defending of WikiLeaks (Operation Payback) or against Sony company (Sony Operation). Anonymous also participated in the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011.

Kimmie had read about this bar in advance so knew to ask for a black light. When you shine a black light on the menu, secret cocktails are revealed. It was quite neat! \[caption id="attachment_1295" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Reading the secret cocktails.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/secret-drinks-prague-600x338.jpg) Reading the secret cocktails.\[/caption\] Jase ordered a cocktail called "V's Blood", which came in a hospital drip bag! Creepy! Many of their other cocktails were also creative - one, called "Wilson", is served on top of a volleyball! \[caption id="attachment_1297" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![V's Blood cocktail.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/v-blood-anon-bar-prague-600x587.jpg) V's Blood cocktail.\[/caption\] During the course of the night we saw several people ordering "Blue Blazers". When ordered, the lights were turned off and the bar ladies poured blue flaming alcohol from one jug to another for several minutes, all while wearing V for Vendetta masks! We're not quite sure how well you can see from those masks, so the stunt was quite impressive. \[caption id="attachment_1296" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It's hard to see in the dark, but the bartender is making a Blue Blazer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/making-blue-blazer-600x338.jpg) It's hard to see in the dark, but the bartender is making a Blue Blazer.\[/caption\] The atmosphere of the place was a little secret-agent-like, but not overly so. We thought the art on the walls was... weird. Overall AnonymouS Bar was an interesting experience, but in terms of drinks and atmosphere we preferred the Hemingway Bar! \[caption id="attachment_1298" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Curious art work at AnonymouS.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/anon-bar-art-600x338.jpg) Curious art work at AnonymouS.\[/caption\]

Alchemy
-------

You might have picked up from our choice to visit the Pinball Museum in Budapest that we enjoy visiting unconventional, quirky museums. In Prague we decided to visit the [Museum of Alchemy](http://www.alchemiae.cz/en)! \[caption id="attachment_1299" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The outside of the museum.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/alchemy-museum-prague-600x338.jpg) The outside of the museum.\[/caption\] When we entered the door, we entered what looked like an old style pharmacy with merchandise scattered around and bits and bobs hanging from the ceiling. Potions were on sale, including one to improve memory and one for lovers. \[caption id="attachment_1300" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some potions for sale in the pharmacy shop.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/alchemy-pharmacy-600x338.jpg) Some potions for sale in the pharmacy shop.\[/caption\] We paid for a guided tour, which only cost 200 CZK (about £7 or $13NZD). The lady led us through a door into a musty and damp-feeling room which had stuffed animals such as a crocodile, an interestingly shaped chandelier, and a bookcase with old books. The tour guide told us some interesting history about the building and the people who used to work there brewing potions. It was rather fascinating! What was also interesting was that the place was only recently rediscovered after some floods. Upon turning a special secret lever in the bookcase, a hidden passageway was revealed. (Sadly the bookcase was only a reproduction. The original was damaged during a flood). It was like something from the movies! We walked down some stairs to a series of underground tunnels where we saw areas set up as they would have been when alchemists were making potions. It was interesting to find out that they used to make their own glass containers to store their potions as one tactic to keep the operation secret. Alchemy was not supported by everyone back in the 16th century. The pharmacy facade also helped to keep the potion brewing operation secret. \[caption id="attachment_1301" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An alchemy lab, set up as it used to be.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/alchemy-lab-600x338.jpg) An alchemy lab, set up as it used to be.\[/caption\] One of the amazing things discovered after the flood was a secret recipe for one of the potions, which was contained in a single vial behind a wall. This recipe was saved and is now used to brew replicas of the "Elixer of Eternal Youth", prepared for Emperor Rudolf II. These days it is made by monks and you can buy it in their shop! !["<yoastmark](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/alchemy-bottle-600x338.jpg) The museum was a really cool experience. We would definitely recommend it! Jase and Kimmie
