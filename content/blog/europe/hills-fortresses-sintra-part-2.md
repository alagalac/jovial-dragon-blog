In our last post we covered the beautiful Quinta da Regaleira. In this post, we cover and the Castle of the Moors and Pena Palace. We managed to do all three in the same day - we walked between Quinta da Regaleira and the Castle of the Moors and then used a loop bus for the rest of the day. 

Castle of the Moors
-------------------

This hilltop medieval castle was built by the Moors in the 8th and 9th centuries. It was taken by Christian forces in 1147, and is now classified a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The castle walls were fun to walk along, and provided amazing views over the valleys. The walls were fairly well preserved, and we likened them to the Great Wall of China. \[caption id="attachment_1584" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Part of the 360 degree view.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-2-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-2.jpg) Part of the 360 degree view.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1585" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Jase admiring the view.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-3-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-3.jpg) Jase admiring the view.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1582" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![View of the defensive wall.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle.jpg) View of the defensive wall.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1583" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Looking from the wall towards Pena Palace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-1-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moors-castle-1.jpg) Looking from the wall towards Pena Palace.\[/caption\] Before heading off to Pena Palace, we had a look around the area where the Moorish people carried out their everyday chores. We saw granaries in the ground, which were used to store cereals and legumes. We also saw some tombs and other sites such as a water tank.

Pena Palace
-----------

A short walk from the Castle of the Moors is the colourful Pena Palace. Pena Palace was used as a residence by the Portuguese royalty in the past. Today, it is an interesting building to visit, with an extensive surrounding park to explore. We bought a multi-ticket when we were at the Castle of the Moors, which gave us admission to the grounds at both places, as well as inside the palace. \[caption id="attachment_1587" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Pena Palace from below.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-from-below-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-from-below.jpg) Pena Palace from below.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1588" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Kimmie on a balcony.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-balcony-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-balcony.jpg) Kimmie on a balcony.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1589" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A grumpy Triton over the door.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-sculpture-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-sculpture.jpg) A grumpy Triton over the door.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1590" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A cool table spread with a ship in the middle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-boat-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-boat.jpg) A cool table spread with a ship in the middle.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1599" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Fancy flower chandelier.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-light-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-light.jpg) Fancy flower chandelier.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1592" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Jase liked these chandelier holders.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-holder-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-holder.jpg) Jase liked these chandelier holders.\[/caption\] The grounds of Pena Palace are very impressive, spanning a very large area. We only explored a small section due to lack of time. However, we found the walk very peaceful and relaxing. There were interesting points of interest along the way, including the Table of the Queen which was made out of stone (and was apparently one of Queen Amélia’s favourite spots), and the High Cross on the hill. \[caption id="attachment_1595" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A view of the palace from the surrounding park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-from-park-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-from-park.jpg) A view of the palace from the surrounding park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1594" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![There was a New Zealand fern section in the park which reminded us of home.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-ferns-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-ferns.jpg) There was a New Zealand fern section in the park which reminded us of home.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1593" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Even the ducks had their own mini-castle!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-ducks-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pena-ducks.jpg) Even the ducks had their own mini-castle!\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

If you're going to Lisbon, we recommend that you do a day trip to Sintra. It's a beautiful area, and we almost felt it was like going out to the country. Inhaling the clean fresh air was lovely and refreshing. We were super lucky with the weather though. Sintra might not be as fun in the rain, as most of the highlights are outdoors. As you can see from our itinerary, it is possible to cram a lot into one day if you arrive when the attractions open. We didn't feel too rushed, but if we had more time available it might have been nice to stay a night in Sintra so that we could enjoy the surroundings for longer. However, the train trip to and from Lisbon was only one hour long, so time wasn't really an issue. Jase and Kimmie
