There's a lot of paperwork to sort out when you first arrive in London. We managed to get the ball rolling on some of the more important ones within our first week.

Getting a bank account
----------------------

Opening a bank account is one third of the infamous moving to the UK Triangle of Pain. The other two parts being getting a job and renting a flat. Getting any one of the three usually requires already having the other two. To open a bank account in the UK you require proof of identity, proof of a UK address, and they also like to see proof of employment. It was recommended to us that we try [Lloyds Bank](https://www.lloydsbank.com/), as they are known for being more lenient on people who have newly arrived in the UK. We had however heard various accounts of people getting rejected, and that some branches are better than others. Rumour also has it that Lloyds has gotten stricter over time. We figured it was worth a shot anyway, as it's difficult and more expensive living here without a UK bank account. Jase also had an advantage with his British passport and a letter from his work. Jase found the closest branch and went in (Kimmie went off and did some errands, as we figured Jase might be luckier if he was by himself). The branch was empty. Amazingly, Jase was not rejected outright when he asked if he could open a bank account! However, they weren't able to see him right away and he was required to book an appointment for that afternoon. This meant he had to wait outside, bored, for several hours in the sun (at least it was sunny!). When the time came, Jase was called into a back room for an hour long interview. They were trialing a new system where the application process was carried out entirely on an iPad. It was interesting observing their very strict rules around what the personal banker could and could not say. He could not say anything that could be seen to be providing financial advice or influencing any decisions. At the end of the interview, the personal banker headed out of the room to get the bank manager. A large man in a pinstriped suit came in and greeted Jase. He put his hand out for a handshake and in a hearty voice exclaimed "Welcome to Lloyds Bank!".

Getting a NINO
--------------

Jase and Kimmie both had to ring up a special phone number to start the ball rolling on their [NINO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance_number) application (a NINO is the equivalent of an IRD number in New Zealand. If you don't have one then you have to pay a high penalty tax rate). Annoyingly, you can't start this process until you're in the UK. The automatic phone greeting reminds you of this several times. After answering several questions over the phone, Jase and Kimmie were required to go down different NINO routes because of their different passports.

### Jase's NINO experience

Jase had to have an interview at a Jobcentre Plus to get his NINO. A Jobcentre Plus is like Work and Income in New Zealand. Outside the one we went to there were lots of dodgy looking people lingering around. There was also a Russian bouncer outside the building making sure that people only entered at the time of their appointment. Inside, the staff were generally rude. A lot of the people there for interviews were from the EU and so English was not their first language. It therefore took them a bit longer to fill in the forms. One of the staff commented "Hurry up, you're not writing a novel!" After a short meeting, where the staff essentially just filled in a postal application on Jase's behalf, his NINO application was posted off. Strangely, and quite unhelpfully, a few days later Jase received a letter in the post reminding him of his appointment at the Job Centre Plus. A little late!

### Kimmie's NINO experience

Luckily, Kimmie didn't need to do an interview. Instead she was sent a bunch of paperwork in the mail. All she needed to do was to fill this in and send it back. Hooray – a rare occasion whereby the non-British passport holder had the easier route!

Getting a BRP
-------------

Kimmie mentioned the BRP in her posts about the visa process. It stands for "Biometric Residence Permit", and she needed to collect it within the first 10 days of her arrival in the UK. The first time we went to collect it the post office was closed, because the opening times on Google Maps were wrong. Lesson learned: never trust the times on Google Maps! :( We went back when the post office was open and waited in line to see the cashier. When called to the front, she handed over her documentation and was asked for her address and phone number. At that point, she could not remember her temporary address nor her brand new phone number. So, she rifled through her bags to find this information. Luckily, the cashier didn't seem concerned that she didn't know this information already! Once she handed over this information the cashier found the correct envelope and handed over her BRP card. It was bright pink! We were not expecting that. Should be easy to spot! Apparently it is really important to keep your BRP safe, as it's even more difficult to replace than a passport. Therefore, she shall be guarding it with her life!

Summary comments
----------------

So that's how we managed to get a couple of our more important tasks done. Not without dramas, but we are thankful that our experience was less bumpy than it could have been. Jase has two of the three Triangle of Pain items sorted. Lucky him! It will be much easier for Kimmie to get herself sorted once we have a place to live (so we can show proof of address).
