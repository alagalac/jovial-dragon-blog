If you enjoy the outdoors it'd pretty hard for you not to like [Kew Gardens](http://www.kew.org/). There's something there for everyone. We managed to spend the whole day at the gardens as there was so much to do and see. Because of this, we also took lots of pictures! We've therefore split this post into two parts.

A little bit of info about the gardens
--------------------------------------

Kew Gardens is in southwest London. It holds the tile of London's largest UNESCO World Heritage site (though, not sure how many competitors there are...).  It is similar in size to Hyde Park (at 121 hectares, compared with Hyde Park's 140 hectares). If you'd like more of a visual, check out [the map](http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/Welcome%20to%20Kew%20map%20spring17.pdf). A large and diverse collection of plants can be found at Kew. We even saw Kiwi and Aussie species!

The great wall of Kew
---------------------

We were surprised to find the gardens surrounded by a giant wall. We thought the gardens would be easy to access like Hyde Park or the Botanical Gardens back home. The reason for the wall is because you have to pay to enter! An adult ticket is £15. After seeing the gardens we understood why the entry wasn't free – talk about upkeep costs! \[caption id="attachment_410" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We found the entry to the gardens eventually.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-jase-entry-600x338.jpg) We found the entry to the gardens eventually.\[/caption\]

A huge botanical wonderland
---------------------------

Walking around, we noticed  there were many wide open spaces. At times we had a whole area ourselves. It was amazing to experience such a sense of space in London. There are also many secluded areas off the beaten path and nice wooden chairs dotted around. \[caption id="attachment_397" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Wide open spaces. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kew-open-space-600x338.jpg) Wide open spaces.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_399" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It feels really spacious walking along Cedar Vista.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kew-cedar-vista-600x338.jpg) It feels really spacious walking along Cedar Vista.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_400" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying one of the many park benches.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kew-jase-chair-600x338.jpg) Jase enjoying one of the many park benches.\[/caption\]

Interesting features
--------------------

### The follies of Kew

The park has some interesting follies, courtesy of people from ages ago with too much money and not much sense. A [folly](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/folly) is:

> a costly ornamental building with no practical purpose, especially a tower or mock-Gothic ruin built in a large garden or park.

The first we stumbled upon was the Temple of Bellona. This was built as a tribute to the Ancient Roman [goddess of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellona_(goddess)), because apparently at the time it was fashionable to have something dedicated to Bellona in your garden. There used to be another temple for the goddess of peace, but that one didn't survive. \[caption id="attachment_404" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Temple of Bellona. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-folly-600x338.jpg) The Temple of Bellona.\[/caption\] Next we stumbled upon the Ruined Arch. For ages people thought the arch had naturally degraded over time, but it turns out that it was purposefully built in "ruins" (just like how you can buy pre-ripped jeans!). \[caption id="attachment_407" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The "ruined" arch.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-folly-2-600x338.jpg) The "ruined" arch.\[/caption\]

### A cottage and a palace

We weren't expecting to find a cottage in the gardens, let alone a royal palace! Queen Charlotte's Cottage is quaint. It has some interesting artifacts as well as a riddle written by a princess. Kimmie very proudly managed to solve the riddle. \[caption id="attachment_415" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The cottage.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-cottage-600x338.jpg) The cottage.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_414" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A picture in the cottage showing a man kissing the hand of a woman.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-cotage-pic-600x338.jpg) A picture in the cottage showing a man kissing the hand of a woman.\[/caption\] Kew Palace was very well kept and had a beautifully manicured garden at the back (called the Queen's Garden). It looked like the palace had been given a fresh lick of paint as its colour was so vibrant. \[caption id="attachment_419" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The palace from the sun dial.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-front-palace-600x338.jpg) The palace from the sun dial.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_418" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The palace's back garden.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kew-fountain-palace-600x338.jpg) The palace's back garden.\[/caption\] In addition to the cottage and the palace, Syon House is visible from the park. The [Duke of Northumberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Northumberland) calls the place home!

### A zen garden

Again, not something we were expecting to see!  There was also a pagoda, but unfortunately it was being renovated. We thought it would probably be something worth coming back to see. \[caption id="attachment_422" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Enjoying the zen garden, ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-zen-garden-600x338.jpg) Enjoying the zen garden,\[/caption\]

### A treetop walkway

Kew is full of surprises! I was very excited to see the treetop walk on the park map. The treetop walk was quite cool, but we think it would have been better if the trees surrounded it more (and were taller than the structure!). The structure could have blended in with its surroundings more. Also, I would have liked it if the walking route was more interesting designed instead of being in a simple circle. \[caption id="attachment_424" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The treetop walkway. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-treetop-600x375.jpg) The treetop walkway.\[/caption\] Stay tuned for part 2!
