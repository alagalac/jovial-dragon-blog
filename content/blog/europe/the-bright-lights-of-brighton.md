A few weekends ago we caught the train down to Brighton for the day.

The famous pier
---------------

On arrival in Brighton, the first thing we did was march down to the pier. Our brisk walk helped to warm us up and counter the chilly sea breeze. \[caption id="attachment_1085" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Brighton Pier.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_pier-600x450.jpg) The Brighton Pier.\[/caption\] We ended up walking along the pebble beach until the pier opened at 10.00am. This wasn't exactly to plan, as Kimmie had arranged for us to arrive early so we could maximise our time in Brighton. She didn't expect Brighton to be so sleepy on a Saturday! There were lots of bars and nightclubs alongside the beach. Brighton looks like it is a party place in the evenings. By contrast, it is very calm and tranquil on a Saturday morning!

### Amusing ourselves at the pier

The amusement park reminded us of [Luna Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_Park_Sydney) in Sydney. It's quite small and in need of a bit of renovation. \[caption id="attachment_1086" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Brighton Pier entrance.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_pierentrance-600x338.jpg) Brighton Pier entrance.\[/caption\] The pier itself is really long, and extends quite far out to sea. There are a couple of restaurants, a few big halls filled with gaming machines, and a bunch of amusement rides at the end. \[caption id="attachment_1093" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The gaming machines on the pier.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_gaming-600x338.jpg) The gaming machines on the pier.\[/caption\] We tried our hand at the games where you put in pennies and try to dislodge prizes. It was a quick way to lose a pound! We didn't end up going on any of the actual rides since they didn't look very exciting, and at £5 per ride they were quite expensive for what they were. \[caption id="attachment_1094" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The rides on the pier.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_rides-600x338.jpg) The rides on the pier.\[/caption\] We also noticed there were lots of sweet treats on the pier, and in Brighton itself. One local specialty is [rock candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(confectionery)), which you buy in thick rolls. We bet that dentists freak out when they see such tooth delaying sights!

Fish and chips on the beach
---------------------------

You can't visit the seaside without having some fish and chips. So far, we'd been disappointed with quality of the fish and chips in the UK. This is probably because we were spoiled back in New Zealand with [gourmet fish and chips](https://www.thechippery.co.nz/). \[caption id="attachment_1083" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Fish and chips on the beach.

The potions were really big, and the fish was quite greasy. It was pretty good, but still not as good as the fish and chips back home! One interesting thing about the fish and chip shop was that they offered "breaded" fish. In New Zealand we call it crumbed fish. In any case, breaded fish is very hard to find over here!

The Lanes
---------

[The Lanes](https://www.visitbrighton.com/shopping/the-lanes) is an area of Brighton filled with lots of cute medieval lanes and alleyways. The lanes had lots of boutique shops, and the most common items for sale seemed to be jewelry and clothing. \[caption id="attachment_1101" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Down one of the lanes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lanes-brighton-600x338.jpg) Down one of the lanes.\[/caption\] One shop was unlike the rest: down one of the alleyways there was a Halloween-style chocolate cafe. \[caption id="attachment_1090" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Spooky edible cakes in the window of the chocolate shop.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_chocolate-600x338.jpg) Spooky edible cakes in the window of the chocolate shop.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1103" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A chocolate dog!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dog-choc-338x600.jpg) A chocolate dog!\[/caption\] Not to be confused with The Lanes, but just over 5 minutes away is another lane called North Laine. We liked this lane better as it had wider range of stores and it seemed more lively. \[caption id="attachment_1096" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Walking down trendy North Laine.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_laines-600x338.jpg) Walking down trendy North Laine.\[/caption\]

Coffee culture
--------------

We noticed that Brighton has quite a good coffee culture, and while strolling around we stumbled upon a few hip looking coffee roasters and cafes that we would be keen to try. We met up with Jase's cousin who lives nearby and chatted at a local coffee shop. \[caption id="attachment_1091" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Here's Johnny at the hipster cafe we visited.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brighton_johnny-600x338.jpg) Here's Johnny at the hipster cafe we visited.\[/caption\]

The Royal Pavilion
------------------

Randomly in the middle of Brighton there is [a palace](http://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/)! It was built for King George IV, and completed in 1823. You could pay to go in and look around inside, but we decided to just admire it from the outside instead. There was also some nice gardens and green space which we enjoyed. \[caption id="attachment_1106" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The palace from the road. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/palace-600x338.jpg) The palace from the road.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1105" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The palace lawns.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/palace2-600x338.jpg) The palace lawns.\[/caption\]

And then came the hail
----------------------

Fortunately the weather held for most of the day, however late in the afternoon dark clouds rolled in. It started raining quite heavily and then hailing! We managed to find a nice vegan/vegetarian cafe called Wai Kika Moo Kau. We tried some delicious parsnip soup while waiting for the bad weather to pass.

Final thoughts
--------------

We enjoyed our day trip to Brighton. There was good food, good coffee, and interesting little shops to check out. While there's a bit to do in Brighton, we think it can all fairly easily be sampled in a day. Brighton is also quite close to central London, so it's not too much of a mission getting there and back. We bought our train tickets in advance, and so it only cost us about £6 per person each way. Jase and Kimmie
