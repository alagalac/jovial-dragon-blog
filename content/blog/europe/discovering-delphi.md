From a dirty Athens bus station in the middle of nowhere (they really need to sort that out) we caught a bus through the Greek countryside to Delphi.

A bit of history  

-------------------

Back in classical times Delphi was considered the centre of the world. It was also the location of the Temple of Apollo and the Oracle of Delphi, who you could consult to tell the future.

In classical times tributes were brought to Delphi from all over the Greek world, which made Delphi a rich city.

Sadly the city fell into ruins after the rise of Christianity, and was mostly forgotten about.

Eventually in the middle ages a town sprang up on the site of the original city. After the ancient city was rediscovered they had to actually move the whole town around the corner to make way for the excavations!

Greece like we imagined  

--------------------------

The scenery around Delphi is absolutely amazing. Delphi is located high up on the side of Mount Parnassus, and has an amazing view of the valley below.

A truly beautiful part of the world.

Jase commented that it looked like the Greece he always imagined, made up of rocky hills dotted with cyprus trees, ancient ruins, and olive groves.

Delphi town  

--------------

The town of Delphi itself was quite small. Most of the shops seemed to be oriented around tourism. We found it funny how all of the hotels were named after different Greek gods. It's perhaps not a place you'd want to stay too long, but it was nice enough for two days.

[![Some pretty steps where we ate in Delphi.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_20180905_144601-1024x576.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_20180905_144601.jpg)

Who gnomes what was going on here?

Delphi didn't have it's own bus station, so instead we had to buy our bus tickets home from a restaurant next to the bus stop. The waiter at the restaurant was very grumpy. After we paid for our tickets he went away and then came back demanding "Why are you still here?" "We're waiting for our bus tickets"Â  "I already gave you!". Eventually he realised he hadn't and he hastily shoved them towards Jase before scuttling away.

Final thoughts  

-----------------

Delphi is a lovely peaceful place with beautiful scenery. The silence in and around the town and ruins made the place feel almost sacred and calming. The food wasn't the best, but our perspective was influenced by the fact that the food in Athens and Santorini was amazing!

We very much enjoyed our travels in Greece and would definitely love to return to soak up more of the culture and delicious food. What an adventure!
