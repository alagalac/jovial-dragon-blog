During the few short months we've been here in London we've caught many tubes. We decided there's a bit of an art to catching the tube, and we thought we'd share some of our tips and observations with you. \[caption id="attachment_1061" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![East Acton tube station.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tube-ea-600x337.jpg) East Acton tube station.\[/caption\]

### Choose your time wisely

*   Find out when peak time is, and avoid it wherever possible. Transport for London says that on average peak times are 06:30 to 09:29 and 16:00 to 18:59 Monday to Friday (check out this nifty [interactive heartbeat map](http://tubeheartbeat.com/london/)!)

### Choose your spot wisely

*   We have noticed that often the end carriages are emptier. It may depend on the station though.
*   If there are no free seats, try to get a place in an aisle between seats. Then you will have more space and you're more likely to get a seat when someone leaves.
*   Avoid sitting in the end seats, as they are priority seats and you could get kicked off.
*   Hit rush hour by accident? To avoid getting squashed (assuming you also missed out on a seat and between-seat spot) try spreading out your legs a bit and maybe putting your bag on the ground by your feet. This gives you a little bit of extra space to breathe. Of course, depending on the crowd this trick might not be possible.

### Entertain yourself

*   Bring something for entertainment. London's quite large so we typically end up spending about 30 minutes sitting inside a tube carriage each time we need to get somewhere. We suggest having something to read (an actual book, or an e-book). There are also free newspapers at the stations, and we love [Timeout](https://www.timeout.com/) Tuesdays!  [Most phone providers provide free WiFi at the stations](https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/station-wifi), but it can be a bit unreliable.
*   If you're new to London, try listening to the location announcements as they teach you how to pronounce the place names! We also enjoy listening to the platform employees, as their spiels are all slightly different. Jase thinks one of the station announcers sounds like [Clara from Dr Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Oswald)!

### Don't be a bother

*   Don't lean on the doors, as this can actually disrupt the train and cause it to stop!
*   Make sure you have your card or ticket ready to swipe at the turnstiles, as people have places to go and no time to waste!
*   Don't bring giant items with you on the tube at peak time. You'll just make everyone around you angry because you're taking up valuable people space.
*   In contrast to back home, you're allowed to eat and drink on the tube. But this can cause such a mess - dropped food and spilled drink. Sometimes it's better to wait until you've reached your destination.

### Be prepared

*   If you get headaches from enclosed warm spaces, consider bringing a water bottle with you on board.
*   Wear a jersey that's easy to take on and off. Usually the temperature outside is much different to the temperature on the tube.
*   Hot wind in the tube and at stations can also be a good way to dry off if you're wet.
*   Trying to take huge suitcases on the tube is never fun, but sometimes you have no choice! Some stations are more accessible than others, and luckily there's a handy [accessibility map](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/avoiding-stairs-tube-guide.pdf)!
*   When it rains the stations can get really wet and slippery. Be really careful and try not to rush!

### Be thrifty

*   Once you're familiar with the tube and have had a crack with an Oyster card, try contactless which is [cheaper in certain instances.](https://londonist.com/2016/06/oyster-fares-and-contactless-not-always-the-same-price) Of course, this requires you to have a UK bank account, but let's not get into that!
*   Sometimes ads at the stations or in the carriages have discount codes (recently, we saw a code which provided a 10% discount for open air cinema).
*   Some stations are actually really close and it can be quicker to walk. The tube map is a bit distorted so it can be difficult to judge how far away stations are. To help, someone created a handy [tube walking map](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/walking-tube-map.pdf)!  To show you how close some tube stations are to one another, check out this guy who [raced a tube between stations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E)!
