Yesterday we were up bright and early to visit the [Tower of London](http://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/).  Here are some of our thoughts.  We ordered our tickets online as it worked out about 15% cheaper than buying the tickets at the gate. We had to queue for a little while to pick up our tickets, but we still managed to make it through the entry just after it opened. \[caption id="attachment_182" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The White Tower in the middle of the Tower of London.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tower-of-london-300x169.jpg) The White Tower in the middle of the Tower of London.\[/caption\]

The Crown Jewels
----------------

As soon as we were inside we made a beeline for the Crown Jewels. There was a really long queuing area, but as we were early we were able to waltz right on in. One thing we weren't quite expecting was just how many items make up the Crown Jewels. There were about a dozen crowns, multiple scepters, ceremonial swords, orbs, gowns, and a wide range of extravagant dinnerware. The [Imperial State Crown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_State_Crown) was particularly impressive. The sheer size and quantity of the gems was incredible. Since we beat the crowds we had the opportunity to take a good look. The Crown Jewels are stored in a huge vault with 2 tonne doors and armed guards outside. We saw some kids bothering one of the guards until he stomped his foot and yelled "STOP IT!". \[caption id="attachment_184" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the guards outside the Crown Jewels.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guard-300x300.jpg) One of the guards outside the Crown Jewels.\[/caption\]

The Beefeaters
--------------

We decided to join one of the [Yeomen Warder (Beefeater)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeomen_Warders) tours. Our Beefeater showed us around the Tower grounds and told us about the history. He also kept it interesting with a few jokes along the way. Whenever we were moving onto a new area he said "Let's beheading to..." \[caption id="attachment_181" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our Beefeater guide.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beefeater-300x169.jpg) Our Beefeater guide.\[/caption\]

The animals
-----------

One thing we found interesting was all of the animals that were historically kept at the Tower grounds. The monarchs liked to keep a small zoo with lions, tigers, monkeys, elephants and other animals. Apparently at one point there was a polar bear which was allowed to swim in the moat! \[caption id="attachment_180" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A model of the Tower elephant.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tower-elephant-300x169.jpg) A model of the Tower elephant.\[/caption\] We enjoyed watching the resident ravens that hop around the grounds. Apparently it is said that if the ravens ever leave then disaster will befall the kingdom. Needless to say, the ravens have been well looked after even to this day. \[caption id="attachment_183" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the Tower ravens.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/raven-300x169.jpg) One of the Tower ravens.\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
