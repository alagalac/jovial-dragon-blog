One of the best things about travel is that you get to sample new and interesting local delicacies... or at least see how other places serve the same type of food and drink!

Food
----

### Breakfast/brunch

The breakfast/brunches we had in Budapest were delicious! They even reminded us of some of our favourite brunch places back home. The pictures speak for themselves! Side note: for the vegans out there, it appears that Budapest has an emerging vegan food scene! We saw several vegan cafes. \[caption id="attachment_804" align="aligncenter" width="509"\]![A cheap and high quality salmon croissant with poached egg and salad.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-breakfast-509x600.jpg) A cheap and high quality salmon croissant with poached egg and salad.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_805" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Freshly made salmon bagel with capsicum pesto.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bagel-600x338.jpg) Freshly made salmon bagel with capsicum pesto.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_809" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![American style pancakes and fruit.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-breakfast1-600x338.jpg) American style pancakes and fruit.\[/caption\]

### Dried food

We'd have liked to try some of the salami or other dried meats on offer. Maybe next time! \[caption id="attachment_808" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A wide range of meat for purchase.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-meat-600x338.jpg) A wide range of meat for purchase.\[/caption\]

### Fried food

#### Lángos

We tried lángos, which is available all over Budapest. It's a deep fried flatbread which looks a bit like a pizza. Lángos is known as a hangover food, and the classic flavour is sour cream and cheese. Kimmie was feeling a bit adventurous (and very sober) and decided to try one with roasted paprika. The paprika was nice, and reminded us of marinated peppers. Funny that, as paprika is made from varieties of capsicum! The things you learn. The dough tasted like an un-sugared doughnut. It was extremely filling with just one lángos being enough for two people. \[caption id="attachment_800" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lángos with paprika.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-langos-600x411.jpg) Lángos with paprika.\[/caption\]

#### Krumplis prósza and zalai dodolle

Krumplis prósza is a potato pancake with (in our case, homemade) sour cream and cheese. It was also quite garlicky. Kimmie very much enjoyed this meal and wanted another one! Yum! Zalai dodolle is potato fried with onions, (and again, homemade) sour cream, and a special kind of Hungarian pumpkin seed oil. The morsels were a bit denser than we were expecting, but they tasted great! Some kind of fried onion and \[we're guessing\] fennel was sprinkled on top. \[caption id="attachment_812" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some yummy traditional Hungarian food.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-trad-food-600x338.jpg) Some yummy traditional Hungarian food.\[/caption\]

### Sausage bread cones

If there's one thing we saw lots of in Budapest, it was sausage. Jase tried a street food made up of a conical bread with sausage and sauerkraut. He described it as similar to eating a hot dog, but with different geometry. \[caption id="attachment_801" align="aligncenter" width="457"\]![Jase trying a triangular sausage bread snack. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-sausage-bread-457x600.jpg) Jase trying a triangular sausage bread snack.\[/caption\]

### Bread

#### Crescent bread

Crescent shaped bread ([like this one](https://kuanju.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dsc_5882.jpg)) is popular and easy to find in Budapest. It's quite chewy and shiny, and they often have salt granules sprinkled on top. The crescents were a good and filling snack food. We wouldn't want to eat them all the time though, as they didn't seem overly nutritious. We noticed a lot of bakeries in Budapest, and they looked like they had a vast array of bread on offer. We'd be keen to try some other varieties next time.

#### Baguettes

We went to this amazing Star Wars themed place called [Bors GasztroBár](https://www.facebook.com/BorsGasztroBar/). It is tiny and had lines out the door both times we went. The lines are for good reason! They serve delicious filled baguettes and soups that make you want to come back for more (which we did!). The menu was mostly in Hungarian, which made ordering a bit tricky. Kimmie saw someone holding a fascinating looking chocolate drink and decided that she must try it. After a bit of confusion with the ordering, Jase manged to get one. It was a runny chocolate dessert drink with jelly cubes at the bottom. It also had an alcoholic taste, but we couldn't figure out exactly what it was. \[caption id="attachment_815" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lines out the door for Star Wars baguettes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bors-sw-600x338.jpg) Lines out the door for Star Wars baguettes.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_816" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with Barack Obama and a French Lady baguettes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bors-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with Barack Obama and a French Lady baguettes.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_814" align="alignnone" width="600"\]![Interesting chocolate dessert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bors-drink-600x338.jpg) Interesting chocolate dessert.\[/caption\]

### Burgers

Burger shops were on every corner! It seems that burgers are popular in Budapest. We got to try some amazing burgers at a place called [Meatology](http://meatologybudapest.hu/). High quality burgers and homemade potato chips! What more could you want?! \[caption id="attachment_807" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Trying the huge and very filling burgers at Meatology. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-dinner-burger-600x338.jpg) Trying the huge and very filling burgers at Meatology.\[/caption\]

### Desserts

Cottage cheese makes a frequent appearance in Hungarian desserts. Kimmie liked some of these cottage cheese desserts, but was not a fan of the classic chocolate covered cottage cheese dessert rolls sold in every supermarket. Jase on the other hand quite liked them. \[caption id="attachment_798" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie holding a few of the interesting supermarket desserts on offer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-desserts-600x421.jpg) Kimmie holding a few of the interesting supermarket desserts on offer.\[/caption\] We enjoyed the ice cream in Budapest. Kimmie had a yummy panna cotta one at one point. We also found these funny looking frozen space ball ice blocks, which of course we had to try (even though they were marketed at kids). We got the lemon-lime flavour. The balls were a bit too sweet, but they were cold and therefore did the trick! \[caption id="attachment_811" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kids space ice block balls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-icecream-space-600x338.jpg) Kids space ice block balls.\[/caption\] Again, the rose flower gelato made an appearance. \[caption id="attachment_799" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Popular rose shaped ice cream.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-icecream-600x338.jpg) Popular rose shaped ice cream.\[/caption\] Another thing we saw lots of was doughnuts. Hungarians must like doughnuts!

Drink
-----

### Coffee

We weren't expecting much, especially as it's such a mission to find decent coffee in London. But Budapest, you surprised us. Amazing little coffee shops are all over the place in Pest (we were based in Pest, but there may also be great coffee in Buda). We  chose our cafes based on reviews from fellow coffee lovers on Google (which is a useful resource!). One reviewer mentioned how Budapest is embracing the "[third wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee)".  We enjoyed sampling great coffee. We were also impressed at the decor of the cafes, which could rival some of the most hipster cafes back in Wellington!  Some of the places we tried, and would recommend are:

*   Kontakt - speciality coffeeshop
*   Madal Cafe
*   Espresso Embassy
*   Budapest Baristas.

Kimmie's favourite was Madal Cafe, because the iced coffees were so delicious. Jase's favourite flat white was from the Espresso Embassy. \[caption id="attachment_787" align="aligncenter" width="471"\]![Great coffee at Espresso Embassy. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-coffee-471x600.jpg) Great coffee at Espresso Embassy.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_788" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Very nicely presented coffee from Madal Cafe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-coffee-1-600x337.jpg) Very nicely presented coffee from Madal Cafe.\[/caption\] The motto at _Kontakt_ is amusing: NO SUGAR, YES GOOD COFFEE. You aren't allowed to order an Americano either! We thought this showed how proud the barista was of his coffee, and his confidence in himself to consistently produce a great cup! We agree that his coffee is fine just the way it is, without sugar. \[caption id="attachment_789" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![No nonsense coffee from Kontakt - speciality coffee shop. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-coffee2-600x430.jpg) No nonsense coffee from Kontakt - speciality coffee shop.\[/caption\] Overall, the worst cup of coffee we had in Budapest was as good as the best cup of coffee we've had in London!

### Alcohol

#### Beer

Jase thought the beer in Budapest was "drinkable". He doesn't have much else to say on this topic as "beer is beer" (unless it is craft beer of course). \[caption id="attachment_795" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying a refreshing cold beer at a ruin bar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-beer-600x338.jpg) Jase enjoying a refreshing cold beer at a ruin bar.\[/caption\]

#### Wine

Kimmie tried a few different types of wine, and none were disappointing! The highlight was a delicious wine from the [Tokaj wine region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokaj_wine_region). Kimmie found it so drinkable that she wrote down the name of it and bought some duty free! One thing that's interesting about ordering wine in Budapest is that they pour by the deciliter. We had no idea how many deciliters to order, but we came to realise that two was a very decent amount of wine! If you want a regular glass of wine, go for one! \[caption id="attachment_794" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying a nice glass of wine from the Tokaj wine region.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-wine-600x337.jpg) Kimmie enjoying a nice glass of wine from the Tokaj wine region.\[/caption\]

#### Spirits

We had to try [unicum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicum) and [pálinka ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Páli), because when in Hungary... Kimmie did not like unicum at all. She found it way too bitter, and not a flavour she could endure for more than one sip. Jase on the other hand managed to push through to the second and third sip, eventually becoming immune to its intense flavour. He even decided he didn't mind it at all, and bought a bottle duty free. In Budapest, they sell hundreds of different flavours of pálinka. Kimmie initially thought that pálinka was a type of wine, as the advertisements always showed a long thin bottle. However, her assumption was squashed when a shot glass was plonked down in front of her. Pálinka has quite a strong, sharp, taste, but it also has a nice warming effect which would be good on a cold day! \[caption id="attachment_806" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![You can drink pálinka any time of the day or night.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-pal-338x600.jpg) You can drink pálinka any time of the day or night.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_803" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cheers! (or Egészségére in Hungarian)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-palinka-600x337.jpg) Cheers! (or Egészségére in Hungarian)\[/caption\]

### Non-alcoholic lemonades

Lemonade, of every flavour, is very popular in Budapest. Which makes sense because it is so refreshing on a hot day. Kimmie tried a range of flavours, including green apple, elderflower, and mango. They were all really delicious and refreshing. \[caption id="attachment_796" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying a berry flavoured lemonade.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-lemonade--600x338.jpg) Kimmie enjoying a berry flavoured lemonade.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

We had a great time eating and drinking our way around Budapest. Pretty much everything we tried was delicious (although some of the fried food was a bit stodgy and wintery). We would love to try more of the culinary delights of Budapest... including the obvious one: goulash. Until we meet again, Budapest! Jase and Kimmie
