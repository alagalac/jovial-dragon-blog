Since arriving in London we've hardly been outside [zone 2](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf), other than for our trip to Paris. So last weekend we caught the train up to visit some of Jase's family in Suffolk and to see the English countryside.

Lavenham
--------

The first place we went to was the small village of Lavenham. \[caption id="attachment_706" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The local church was very impressive.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_church-600x338.jpg) The local church was very impressive.\[/caption\] Lavenham was a wealthy wool town during the 15th century, but subsequently fell upon hard times. This meant very few of the buildings were upgraded or replaced. A lot of old medieval buildings remain. Lavenham is a very cute, quiet, and peaceful place. The houses are colourful, and we learnt that Suffolk has it's own colour – [Suffolk pink](http://www.fennwright.co.uk/contact-us/news/the-history-behind-suffolk-pink-houses/)! We were surprised to stumble upon a shop selling cheese scones. They only seem to sell date scones in London city! Naturally, we had to try a cheese scone, along with a classic British pork pie from the local butcher. The scone was served cold, but it was still tasty. \[caption id="attachment_705" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The old buildings in Lavenham.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_buildings-600x338.jpg) The old buildings in Lavenham.\[/caption\] As you can see from the picture, many of the timber beams have warped over time, leading to wonky houses!

Kersey
------

Our next stop was a small traditional village called Kersey. \[caption id="attachment_709" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A cute cottage painted in the traditional Suffolk pink colour.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_cottage-600x338.jpg) A cute cottage painted in the traditional Suffolk pink colour.\[/caption\] We had a pint in the local pub. It was built in 1379! The floor inside was cobbled brick, and it had a huge fireplace. We could imagine it roaring in the middle ages. It was amazing to have a drink in such an old place! Jase tried one of the local beers on tap called Adnams Southwold Bitter. \[caption id="attachment_710" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Bell Inn.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_pub-600x338.jpg) The Bell Inn.\[/caption\]

Jimmy's farm
------------

We were lucky enough to be invited to an evening performance of Shakespeare's _As You Like It_. It was in the woods at [Jimmy's farm](http://jimmysfarm.com/). It poured down with rain, but we luckily stayed dry under an awning. [Jimmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doherty_(farmer)) is an interesting guy, and he built up his empire from raising rare pig breeds. Apparently he also hangs out with Jamie Oliver!

Felixstowe
----------

The small Hamlet of Felixstowe Ferry is a tiny fishing village at the mouth of the River Deben. For a fee you could ride a small boat across the river mouth. \[caption id="attachment_707" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![People crabbing by the ferry.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_ferry-600x338.jpg) People crabbing by the ferry.\[/caption\] We walked around the promenade towards the town of Felixstowe itself. Everything was much cleaner and tidier than in London city. We also were lucky enough to see Felixstowe's brand new pier. Apparently it had only just reopened about a week ago! It houses an inside arcade at the entry, and kids were happily feeding coin after coin into the machines. We also noticed that, unlike what we are used to seeing, the machines spat out coins instead of prizes or tokens. \[caption id="attachment_711" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The beach at Felixstowe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_promenade-600x338.jpg) The beach at Felixstowe.\[/caption\] We saw huge round defensive forts dotted along the coast from the Napoleonic era.

Dedham Vale
-----------

Finally we went on a country walk around Dedham Vale in the heart of Constable Country. John Constable grew up and painted many of his works there, and hence the name. \[caption id="attachment_713" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The River Stour.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_river-600x338.jpg) The River Stour.\[/caption\] Our walk took us through the beautiful English countryside along ancient country paths past meadows,  gentle hills and friendly cows! We even saw some sheep – it was like being back in New Zealand! \[caption id="attachment_712" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view from the hill.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/suffolk_hill-600x338.jpg) The view from the hill.\[/caption\] We had a great weekend escape away from London city. It was good to have a change in pace from the hustle and bustle of the big smoke. The countryside is really peaceful. Thanks to Jase's family for letting us stay, giving us a tour, and showing us a good time! Jase and Kimmie
