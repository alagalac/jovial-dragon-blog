Kimmie was keen to get out into nature, so she suggested that we try the Masca Gorge walk. It can be done in a day, and takes about 3 hours to complete. 

Getting to Masca Gorge
----------------------

We had to get up early in order to get one of the only buses that connects with the bus to Masca. The connecting bus only runs three times a day! If you miss the bus you have to catch a taxi.

Jase had a go at speaking a little Spanish, asking the bus driver for two tickets to our first destination, Santeigo del Teide. The bus driver understood what he said, which was a bonus!

After about an hour on the bus, we were dropped off at the little  village Santiago del Tiede. We saw a sign for a water taxi (you need to catch one at the end of the walk to get back to civilization) and a lady came over to tell us that we should book one as it was a windy day so the boats may not be as frequent. Jase told the lady that we had already booked online (€2 discount!).

We weren't entirely sure where to get the connection from at the village, as there weren't any obvious signs. We asked a nearby bus driver who appeared to be on a break. He helpfully pointed us up the footpath, telling us to wait 10 minutes.

We waited in the bus shelter. A different bus stopped in front of us. After about 5 minutes, the driver of the bus (the same guy who pointed us to the bus stop), asked if we were going to get on. Turned out the bus had switched numbers while in front of us in the bus stop!

The drive to the gorge was steep and very zig-zagged. Jase thought the road was a marvel of engineering. Full marks to our bus driver - we were happy not to be the ones driving!

We thought Masca was a cute little village perched of the top of the gorge. Before heading off on our walk, we had a lovely morning tea at a local place with an excellent view! They had great freshly made cakes and fresh-from-the-tree orange juice!

Descending the gorge
--------------------

We took our time on the descent down the gorge. We didn't want to just be looking at our feet - we wanted to appreciate our surroundings. So, we paused often, and stopped every now and then.

Kimmie noticed many goats on the hills. She also made friends with some curious little birds.

At times it was easy, at other times we navigated over rocks, streams, and muddy areas. There were times we even had to slide down boulders. \[caption id="attachment_1429" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View while on the walk.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masca-1-600x338.jpg) View while on the walk.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1428" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The only civilised structure we saw on the way down!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/only-civilised-structure-masca-600x338.jpg) The only civilised structure we saw on the way down!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1425" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cacti everywhere...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masca-2-600x338.jpg) Cacti everywhere...\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1424" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The gorge was so high, it made us feel small.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masca-3-600x338.jpg) The gorge was so high, it made us feel small.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1422" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase stepping on rocks to cross the pond.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/j-pond-masca-600x338.jpg) Jase stepping on rocks to cross the pond.\[/caption\]

The track was not well defined. We went the wrong way on several occasions. Luckily, the track is quite popular (even in off-peak season) and we could often make out the path by following the tracks left by others. If in doubt, we tried following the stream, but Jase found out that even this tactic is not fool-proof. Whenever we saw a number marker on a rock it was such a relief!

While the track is popular, you do have periods of time where you are alone. We let people go past us a lot (some people were on a mission to go down as fast as possible!), as we didn't want people on our tail and we also weren't in a rush!

We were quite disappointed and disgusted by how much rubbish we saw along the trail. Why must people litter? You're meant to go to the toilet before you start the track, and in regards to food rubbish, you only have to carry your rubbish for a few hours and then take it to a bin on the mainland! It really did spoil the beauty of the trail for us.

Finishing off the walk
----------------------

All in all, the walk took us three hours. This despite the fact we were walking slowly and taking our time.

Since we finished earlier than expected, we were 1.5 hours too early for our water taxi booking. We talked to the lady at the pop-up beach desk and she said that if some pre-booked people did not show up in the next 15 minutes we could take their spots on the boat. 15 minutes later they had not arrived, so that worked in our favour!

The temperature was also perfect for skimming along the water! We passed by huge cliffs and interesting rock formations. \[caption id="attachment_1420" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our speed boat back to the mainland.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/speed-boat-masca-600x338.jpg) Our speed boat back to the mainland.\[/caption\]

Later that day
--------------

We felt a bit out of place during the hour long bus ride back to our accommodation. It was like a mobile retirement home - everyone was over the age of 60!

To finish off the day, we treated ourselves to dinner at an Argentinian steak restaurant called [La Brasserie](http://gourmetland.net). The steaks were deliciously decadent and filling - highly recommended after a long walk.
