We needed to change trains on our way to Monterosso, so we thought that we may as well make the most of it and stop off in Pisa briefly to check out the leaning tower. Some things you just have to do while you’re in Italy, right?

The famous tower
----------------

We can confirm that the tower is in fact on a lean, and the the lawn is immaculate.

We took a picture.

It was a good place to take funny photos. Lots of people were joining in.

Why not?

Lots of other people had the same idea.

What else?
----------

It seems like most people visiting Pisa get off the train, walk to the leaning tower for a photo, and then walk back to the train station. That's basically what we did.

After our 15 minutes of photos, we started walking back, but stopped off at a nice Australasian style café which we had scoped out a few months ago. It was probably the best coffee we had in all Italy. Nice coffee, good music, and avo on toast. What more do you want?

On the way back to the train station we crossed a bridge over the river which made a funny echoing sound when you slapped your hand on it. We also passed a lot of police and soldiers looking very bored.

The Arno river.

Just as we caught the train the sun was gone and it started raining. We seem to have been lucky with the weather.
