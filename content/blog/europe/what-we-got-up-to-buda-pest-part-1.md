We enjoyed exploring both Buda and Pest, which definitely have different vibes. In this two-part post we share some of the fun activities we got up to on both sides of the river. 

Connecting Buda and Pest
------------------------

To get from one side of the river to the other, we decided to walk over the famous "chain bridge". It didn't take long to cross - maybe around 10 minutes. The Széchenyi Chain Bridge was originally built between 1839 and 1849. At the time of its construction, it was the second-largest spanning suspension bridge in the world. Unfortunately, the bridge was almost completely destroyed by retreating German troops at the end of World War II. However, it was rebuilt and reopened in 1949 (exactly hundred years after its initial inauguration). There is an intriguing story about this bridge. It is said that the sculptor, Marschalko János, forgot to carve out the lions’ tongues (lions feature at both ends of the bridge). The story goes that when told about this imperfection, the sculptor was so embarrassed he committed suicide by jumping into the Danube. Upon further research, I found out that the sculptor was alive right up until the 1870s and that the lions do have tongues - they just can’t be seen from the sidewalk. \[caption id="attachment_869" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View of Buda Castle from the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-castle-view-from-chain-bridge-600x338.jpg) View of Buda Castle from the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_860" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the four lions.

It does not look any more impressive than the bridges in London. In fact, it could do with a little TLC, as it is a little run down and people have unfortunately graffitied on it.

### Riding the funicular

We could have walked up the hill, but we wanted to compare the Budapest Castle Hill Funicular to the Wellington Cable Car. We concluded that the Cable Car wins in terms of value for money, as the Budapest Castle Hill Funicular is relatively expensive for the very short journey up the hill. The Budapest Castle Hill Funicular wins in terms of cuteness though! \[caption id="attachment_891" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Nice artwork at the bottom of the funicular.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-funicular-art-600x355.jpg) Nice artwork at the bottom of the funicular.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_864" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie snagged a front row seat on the mini funicular.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-funicular-2-600x338.jpg) Kimmie snagged a front row seat on the mini funicular.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_865" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The zig-zag funicular.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-funicular-600x337.jpg) The zig-zag funicular.\[/caption\]

### View from Buda Castle

It was lovely looking at the view of Pest from Buda Castle. \[caption id="attachment_859" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A view of the chain bridge from Buda Hill.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-chain-b-600x338.jpg) A view of the chain bridge from Buda Hill.\[/caption\] There were a few interesting bits and bobs to check out at the top, but we didn't bother to go to the art exhibition in the castle. \[caption id="attachment_872" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A statue in front of Buda Castle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-castle-top1-600x337.jpg) A statue in front of Buda Castle.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_873" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some nearby guards standing outside Sándor Palace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-castle-guards-600x338.jpg) Some nearby guards standing outside Sándor Palace.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_875" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The machine that ate Jase's money :( ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-machine--600x338.jpg) The machine that ate Jase's money :(\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_876" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A cute alleyway we stumbled upon.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-allyway-600x338.jpg) A cute alleyway we stumbled upon.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_878" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Looking out over Buda.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buda-view-600x338.jpg) Looking out over Buda.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_879" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A tourist-less walkway!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buda-walkway-600x338.jpg) A tourist-less walkway!\[/caption\]

### Labyrinth of Buda Castle

While we were in the castle area, we decided to check out the [labyrinth beneath it.](http://labirintus.eu/) When you first start walking around inside you go past chambers filed with creepy mannequins dressed in preparation for a masked ball. There was haunting Hungarian opera playing in the background, which was very eerie. Next the labyrinth took on a more sinister tone as we read the story of Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, who was imprisoned there. The caves became very damp , cold, and were thick with fog. Around this area Kimmie started to feel about uncomfortable. It was a bit creepy, to say the least. Mainly due to the low lighting and gravestones and mists... For the brave, there is a tunnel in pitch darkness, but Kimmie was not very keen to do that! The final part of the labyrinth was a bit of an exhibition of other caves from around the world. It seemed a bit out of place, bu there were lots of beautiful pictures of different caves on the walls. The cave tunnel system was quite long, and it took about 30 minutes to go around it. We were glad to leave and get back out to the the daylight and warmth. \[caption id="attachment_883" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Entry down into the Labyrinth. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-cave-600x338.jpg) Entry down into the Labyrinth.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_882" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![What part of the cave tunnel was like.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-cave-2-600x338.jpg) What part of the cave tunnel was like.\[/caption\]

### Fisherman's Bastion

There's not much here. But the architecture of the terrace and surrounding buildings is pretty. \[caption id="attachment_885" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Crawling with tourists...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bastion-2-600x337.jpg) Crawling with tourists...\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_886" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase and a snippet of Pest.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-bastion-3-600x338.jpg) Jase and a snippet of Pest.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_887" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pretty, right?

Festival of folk art
--------------------

Kimmie saw that a festival of folk arts was conveniently on while we were in Budapest! So we made time to visit it on our last day. The festival was made of pop-up wooden huts that spiraled around Buda Hill. It was fascinating wandering around the different stalls. The festival didn't just have Hungarian arts and food, there was folk art from around the world. The market offerings did get a bit repetitive after a while. The following were popular items on sale: soap, lavender-scented everything, gingerbread, honey, wooden children's toys, jewelry, textiles, similar style clothing, and pottery. We didn't buy any "things" because we couldn't take them back with us and we don't have a house in which to put them. But we did sample the food! We also enjoyed the singing and other entertainment. One thing we noticed while at the festival was that a certain hue of blue ([like this](http://www.kekfestocotton.co.uk/images_uploads/fek_011_b.jpg)) featured in a lot of Hungarian art and clothing. After noticing this, we suddenly saw people wearing this colour everywhere in Budapest! \[caption id="attachment_893" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some cute garden ornaments being sold.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buda-market-600x338.jpg) Some cute garden ornaments being sold.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_892" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A few of the wood work and craft market stalls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/buda-market-2-600x338.jpg) A few of the wood work and craft market stalls.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_894" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A traditional kids merry go round?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-merry-go-around-600x337.jpg) A traditional kids merry go round?\[/caption\]

Final thoughts on Buda
----------------------

Buda felt a lot sleepier than Pest. We did enjoy wandering around Buda, but we probably enjoyed exploring Pest more! Speaking of Pest, we'll be talking about what we did there in a future post! Jase and Kimmie
