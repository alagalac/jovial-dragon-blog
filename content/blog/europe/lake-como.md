The final stop on our grand tour was Varenna, on the shore of Lake Como. Sadly the weather did not seem to want to co-operate with us while we were there, but the scenery was still dramatic and atmospheric. Lots of photos of misty mountains incoming!

Lifestyle of the rich and famous
--------------------------------

Something about Lake Como make it feel like a millionaire's playground. The whole location was serene, but immaculate and stylish. The place seemed to ooze wealth. You'd half-expect James Bond to show up around the corner.

The walk of lovers in Varenna.

There are lots of opulent villas surrounding the lake. We decided to take a look around Villa Monastero. It was very beautify, wrapping around the lake foreshore.

The Villa Monastero gardens.

We also hiked up to the Castello di Vezio on the hill behind Varenna. It was beautifully preserved.

A trip to Bellagio
------------------

We caught the lake ferry over to Bellagio to see what it was all about.

Lots of misty clouds on the hills.

While we were there a classic car rally rumbled through the narrow streets. We had to duck into one of the shops to make way!

What about the food?
--------------------

It wouldn't be Italy if we didn't take about the food. Each morning we went to one of the lakeside cafes for a coffee and croissant. The croissants weren't very nice though as they were filled with sickly pistachio cream!

Our breakfast.

We did however find a nice restaurant which was a part of a fancy hotel, where we had wine with a complementary antipasto platter.

In summary
----------

We could well imagine that the place would be lovely in good weather, but in the misty rain we found that there wasn't as much to do. Maybe we will return again when there is some good weather?
