In May 2019 is was finally time for us to bid London good-bye for now. However before we landed back in New Zealand we went on one last hurrah. There was one last major European destination which had eluded us so far: Italy. So on our way home we spent three weeks holidaying around Italy.

Our trip around Italy started in Venice. Originally we’d only planned on staying one night, but we were glad that we extended it to two. We'd also initially planned on staying outside of Venice on the mainland, but we were glad that we managed to find a nice place in Venice itself.

Getting lost
------------

Venice is a wonderful city to wander around and get lost in the back streets. Google Maps doesn’t work very well with all of the narrow windy streets, so you just had to walk in a direction and hope for the best. Once you get away from the main tourist areas, the streets were deserted.

Of all the European cities we have visited, Venice seemed to have the best preserved medieval streets.

Burano
------

On our main day in Venice we caught the boat over to Burano, and island which is famous for their lacework, biscuits, and colourful buildings. It was an Instagrammer’s dream.

We ate the Esse biscuits fresh from a small bakery. They were warm and delicious.

We loved the colourful buildings everywhere. Apparently, there are strict regulations around what colours people can paint their houses. The locals seem to get really in to it, and even theme their flowers and homeware around it.

While in Burano Jase really wanted to try Cone e Misto Fritto, a traditional meal of mixed fried seafood in a cone. We washed it down with some Aperol spritz.

Cicchetti time
--------------

We found a nice bar around the back canals of Venice where we partook in one of the local traditions, Cicchetti. At happy hour, the bar put out small bites which you can purchase for about 1 euro with your drink. We had these for a cheap and easy dinner.

Sight seeing
------------

While we were in Venice we also made our way over to the Rialto bridge, Piazza San Marco, and the Bridge of Sighs. They were all really crowded.

Rialto Bridge. They're strict about not sitting down here.

We didn’t bother with a gondola ride, as it was quite expensive. They also all seemed to follow the same route and looked a bit boring. Not really anything which you couldn’t see by just walking around.

In summary
----------

We really enjoyed visiting Venice, more so than we thought we would. We had low expectations, thinking that it would be too touristy and tacky. But what we actually found was that once you got off the main drag it was an amazing place with beautiful sights to see and yummy food to eat. Well worth a visit.
