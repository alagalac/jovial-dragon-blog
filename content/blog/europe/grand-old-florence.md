Our next stop was Florence. We managed to book a private room in a small hostel close to the Duomo in central Florence.

The Boboli Gardens
------------------

They get a lot of tourists in Florence, and so you need to line up and buy expensive passes for everything. We didn't really feel like lining up and paying to visit the Uffizi Gallery, and felt like all of the artwork was a bit lost on us! Instead we went to visit the Boboli Gardens, a huge garden originally planted for the wealth Medici family.

We had fun exploring the expansive gardens and marveling at the statues.

Palazzo Vecchio
---------------

After deciding that we had to visit some of the big-ticket expensive touristy sites, we decided to visit Palazzo Vecchio, the town hall of Florence. It's less busy than some of the other attractions, but we still had to wait in line to get a ticket from a grumpy ticket seller.

Inside the Palazzon Vecchio there was a lot of amazing artwork on the walls and ceiling.

While there we noticed some funny men outside. While we were up on the parapets we heard some trumpets and drumming. Then a small parade came marching up to the base of the building below us. They fired off their cannons, and then they marched back off again. It looked like a changing of the guard ceremony.

The Duomo
---------

Our accommodation was close to the Duomo, so we were able to book an early morning slot for visiting and climbing to the top of Brunelleschi's dome. It was really interesting learning about the construction of the dome, and how ingenious Brunelleschi's design was.

We also climbed to the top of the bell tower, which was very windy. We didn't bother to go inside the main section of the Duomo as the lines were always so long!

Florentine steak
----------------

Like with the rest of Italy, they love their food in Florence. At the recommendation of the owner of our hostel, we made a booking at the local restaurant Iâ€™Brindellone to try the local steak. It was luck that we did, as when it was time for dinner there was a huge line down the street to get in. We to walk straight in with our reservation!

An interesting system they have in Florence is a lot of the bars offer "aperitivo", a system whereby every night the set up a buffet of food which you can eat for free when you buy a drink. We took advantage of this!

While wandering around, we came across huge crowds outside a bunch of sandwich shop (it was three different outlets of the same shop on the same street). We decided to check it out and see what the fuss was about, and ended up having some delicious focaccia sandwiches for lunch. Apparently All'Antico Vinaio is rated as on the the best street-food places in Italy.

Cycling the Tuscan countryside
------------------------------

Through Airbnb we booked a cycling tour through the Tuscan countryside. The tour itself was okay, but there were parts where we were cycling off-road through the mud which we weren't expecting. The transport which they used too and from Florence also wasn't great as Jase ended up sitting in an unsecured deck chair in the back of a van.

We still had a good time though, and it was nice to get out of the city for a bit of country air.

Wandering around Florence
-------------------------

We stumbled upon a few other interesting things around Florence.

In summary
----------

Visiting Florence was a bit different for us. It was a lot more touristy than many places we usually go to, and it seems like a lot of the tourism here is aimed towards lining up and visiting expensive palaces, churches, and galleries to look at artwork, which isn't really our style. But we still had fun and got to see a lot of interesting history.
