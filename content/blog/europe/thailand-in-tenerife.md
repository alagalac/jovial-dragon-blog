Recently we ventured over to Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, for some winter sun. No visit would be complete without a trip to the world's best water park, [Siam Park](http://siampark.net/index.php/en/).

The first people there
----------------------

The day after we arrived in Tenerife the forecast was for good weather. In anticipation, we woke up early to get to the park at the opening time of 10:00am. Our accommodation ([La Tortuga hostel](http://www.latortugahostel.com/homepage/)) offered a free breakfast from 8:30am, and so we were there waiting on the dot for our pancakes. By 9:00am no pancakes had eventuated, so Kimmie demanded that we get a move on. We figured they were on "island time", and we couldn't miss the park opening. We walked for 40 minutes to get to the park. There is a free shuttle bus, but that only arrives at 10:30am, which we decided would be too late. When we arrived at the front gates for the park nothing was open, and we were the only people there. 10:00am came and went. \[caption id="attachment_1385" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Waiting for the park to open.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siam_waiting-600x450.jpg) Waiting for the park to open.\[/caption\] Eventually, a few bus-loads of people arrived. At this point we were getting a bit anxious. Why haven't they opened yet? We wanted to get in early before all the crowds. A man walked up to a sign and said "the bad news is that it doesn't open until 10:00am". That's strange, we thought. It's already 10:30am. We decided to Google the time in Tenerife, just to be sure. Turned out our phones were an hour ahead, on the Spanish Mainland time and not Canary Island time. Doh! ![](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siam_sign-600x338.jpg) A random aside, but mainland Spain is actually on the wrong time-zone. During WWII the Spanish dictator Franco changed the time-zone of Spain from GMT to match the time-zone of Nazi Germany. Seventy years later they still haven't switched it back! No wonder they always stay up so late in Spain. Back to the story, since we were an hour at the park we were the very first in line, and the second we were let in Kimmie was the first person in the park. We excitedly ran to the lockers and then off to the most popular rides. It was quite surreal. \[caption id="attachment_1392" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Woo hoo!

The rides
---------

You can probably guess form the name, but Siam Park has a strong Thai influence. Apparently it has the biggest collection of Thai-style buildings outside of Thailand. \[caption id="attachment_1389" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![People on the Mai Tai lazy river.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siam_river-600x338.jpg) People on the Mai Tai lazy river.\[/caption\] Because we were the first people in the park, we managed to be the first people on a few of the rides. We were first on the most popular and scariest ride, the Tower of Power, a 28m (about 9 stories!) high slide. The worst part about this slide was getting to the top of the tower and looking down. It was really high. The ride itself was so fast, and was over in about 10 seconds. Due to all the water spray we could hardly open our eyes to see anything. Towards the bottom we shot through the middle of a shark tank! \[caption id="attachment_1387" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Tower of Power.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siam_tower-600x338.jpg) The Tower of Power.\[/caption\] We also managed to hop on Singha, a water roller-coaster. This one sped around a track quite fast, dumping huge amounts of water on us the whole time. The lifeguard at the bottom was amazed that we managed to ride it three times consecutively. \[caption id="attachment_1388" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Dragon. We didn't like this one so much!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siam_dragon-600x338.jpg) The Dragon. We didn't like this one so much!\[/caption\] Kimmie's favourite ride was Kinnaree, a four person ride where you slide around on a giant biscuit. Jase's favourite was The Giant where you slide around a giant bowl before falling down a hole in the middle. \[caption id="attachment_1382" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Siam Park rides tally.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20180120122208_hd-600x441.png) Our Siam Park rides tally.\[/caption\] In total we managed to go on 29 rides! We certainly go our money's worth, and with time to spare.

The fast-pass system
--------------------

There was an option to buy a fast-pass which allows you to skip the line for each ride once, at a cost of â‚¬15 each. As you can see from our ride tally, it's not worth it in low season. For most rides there was no queue; the longest we had to wait was about 10 minutes. At one point, we encountered a sightly obnoxious family that obviously had money to burn, and who had invested in fast passes to jump the really small lines. We were at the front of the line, but they got priority. However, the attendant at the ride obviously wasn't expecting people with fast passes, and didn't have a pen to mark off their ride. Everybody had to wait around while the attendant went off to find one. By the time he got back, everyone could have gone down... Also, we noticed that they completely ignored all the safety instructions, deciding not to hang on at all.

Heading home
------------

After we'd had our fill of rides we caught the complementary bus home. The bus had an open top which was quite fun, although some people behind us kept getting hit in the face by palm tree branches! For dinner we went to what would become our favourite and well-frequented Czech-Canarian restaurant, [Orange Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/OrangeCafeTenerife). There we had some traditional Canarian potatoes and fresh anchovies in garlic while watching the sea. We had a fun day out, and we enjoyed the perfect temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. We are keen to visit more water parks in the future, although they be a disappointment after this one! Jase and Kimmie
