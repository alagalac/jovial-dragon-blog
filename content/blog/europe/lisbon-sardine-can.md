When it comes to deciding where to have a getaway, we have a few criteria. Ideally it's cheap, interesting, has good food, and also better weather than London! Several people have recommended Lisbon to us, so we decided to check it out for ourselves.

Getting to our hostel in Lisbon
===============================

We're really lucky to live nearby a [Thameslink](https://www.thameslinkrailway.com/) station. The Thameslink goes to both Luton and Gatwick airports and runs all day and night. Which is perfect for when you have to get up early to catch a 7:30am flight! We had a pretty stress-free journey to Lisbon, and once we arrived all we had to do was buy a Viva viagem card (similar to London's Oyster card) and hop on a few trains. \[caption id="attachment_1514" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Quirky art near the ticket machines.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/art-underground-tickets-lisbon-600x338.jpg) Quirky art near the ticket machines.\[/caption\] The underground is easy to navigate. The metro has four coloured lines with cute little logos. Within 30 minutes we were in central Lisbon. [Our stylish and laid back hostel](http://www.travellershouse.com/th/home.html) was very well located and welcoming. Upon arrival, we were greeted with tea and coffee and offered a shower. One of the hosts gave us a tour of the hostel and shared many recommendations with us, even drawing us a personalised walking map. \[caption id="attachment_1509" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A snapshot of the lounge at our hostel.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180227_072445-338x600.jpg) A snapshot of the lounge at our hostel.\[/caption\]

Wandering around Alfama
=======================

It was a lovely sunny day on the Saturday of our arrival, making it a great day to explore the city. We spent most of the day trekking around the hills of Alfama. Lisbon infamously suffered from a major earthquake in 1755, which leveled a lot of the city and caused fires and a tsunami. Alfama was luckier than other areas as the buildings didn't totally collapse, and so it retains its original medieval street layout instead of the more modern grid pattern. It's a maze of narrow alleyways up and down the hill. \[caption id="attachment_1525" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A cute little outdoor restaurant.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisbon-tables-600x338.jpg) A cute little outdoor restaurant.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1526" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some of the nicer alleyways.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_155300-2-600x338.jpg) Some of the nicer alleyways\[/caption\] Alfama has a very rustic feel to it. It's a bit run down and rough around the edges, and there is a lot of washing hanging up in front of people's places. \[caption id="attachment_1511" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Washing - a common sight in Alfama.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_131914-600x338.jpg) Washing - a common sight in Alfama.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1512" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Colourful cobbled streets.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_155753-338x600.jpg) Colourful cobbled streets.\[/caption\] We wandered through the alleyways and came across the [Church of Santa Engrácia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Santa_Engr%C3%A1cia "More at Wikipedia "), also known as the National Parthenon. These days the building is a memorial site for important Portuguese people. Like the Sagrada Familia, this building took a long time to build. In this case it was 285 years, and it was only completed in 1966. \[caption id="attachment_1528" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inside the pantheon.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_143009-600x338.jpg) Inside the pantheon.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1529" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Outside the pantheon.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_145149-600x338.jpg) Outside the pantheon.\[/caption\] The dome inside is very impressive, and there is also a nice view from the upper balcony. The guy at our hostel thinks this place is underrated - perhaps that's part of it's charm, as it was very quiet and serene. \[caption id="attachment_1530" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![On the balcony of the pantheon.

Tiles
-----

Many of Lisbon's buildings are covered in tiles They vary in quality, with some broken and others with misprinted designs. Nevertheless, the tiles were fascinating and we really enjoyed all the different designs. \[caption id="attachment_1510" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some of the pretty tiles we encountered.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tile-collage-600x600.jpg) Some of the pretty tiles we encountered.\[/caption\]

Pastel de nata
--------------

Many places have a dish they are known for. You go to New Orleans for beignets, Paris for baguettes, Wellington for cheese scones, and Lisbon for pastel de nata. \[caption id="attachment_1522" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some pastel de nata.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisbon-nata-600x338.jpg) Some pastel de nata.\[/caption\] Pastel de nata are small custard tarts. The outside is a type of filo pastry, and in the middle they have egg-y custard which is charred on top. Often people (such as Kimmie) sprinkle cinnamon on top. While we were in Lisbon we tried four different pastel de nata, including at the famous Pastéis de Belém where they were first invented. All of them were quite satisfying, but the freshly baked ones were best. \[caption id="attachment_1523" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pasteis de Belém.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisbon-belem-600x338.jpg) Pasteis de Belém.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1524" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![You could watch them baking the pastel de nata.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisbon-baking-600x338.jpg) You could watch them baking the pastel de nata.\[/caption\] We were pleasantly surprised that the famous Pastéis de Belém, apparently the most reviewed bakery on TripAdvisor, wasn't as busy as we were expecting. We managed to walk straight in a get a table at lunchtime. Our waiter was _a bit_ clumsy to say the least. He initially gave us the another table's food, and then he got Kimmie's order wrong. He was very slow, and we ended up waiting a long time for the bill. We nicknamed him Manuel. Jase liked the tart from Pastéis de Belém the best, as it had a more savoury, eggy taste, however Kimmie preferred the sweeter version from Manteigaria, which has a shop inside the Timeout food hall.

Catching the trams
------------------

Lisbon has a pretty good public transport system. One thing that really stands out are the trams, funiculars, and elevators. \[caption id="attachment_1531" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The pretty little funicular.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180226_120208-600x338.jpg) The pretty little funicular.\[/caption\] The funiculars and trams have a very _Wes Anderson_ vibe to them, with a bright vibrant yellow livery. We caught the [Ascensor da Glória](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevador_da_Gl%C3%B3ria) down the hill, which was fun although we could have walked it just as fast. Tram number 22 is the most famous, and it follows a route through the central city past a lot of the tourist attractions. We didn't catch end up catching it as our accommodation warned us that it is full of pickpockets. We walked the route ourselves instead. \[caption id="attachment_1532" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Elevador Santa Justa provides a cool shortcut up the hill.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180226_093152-2-600x337.jpg) Elevador Santa Justa provides a cool shortcut up the hill.\[/caption\] Since we had a lot of extra money on our travel cards that we couldn't get a refund on, we waited in line for 15 minutes to catch the very touristy [Santa Justa Lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Justa_Lift "More at Wikipedia "). The ride itself was short and not overly exciting, but the lift design was very interesting. It was built out of wrought iron, and reminded us of the Eiffel Tower.

Canned fish
-----------

Another iconic edible symbol of Lisbon is canned fish. We came across a number of stores selling all varieties of canned fish in lots of colourful different cans. You wouldn't believe how many different varieties and brands there were! \[caption id="attachment_1533" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![So I heard you like canned fish?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180225_173836-600x338.jpg) So I heard you like canned fish?\[/caption\] In one of the more touristy shops you can pick a year and get a can stamped with that year and a random fact relating to that year. In another store, you could get the perfect birthday present for your loved one: a gift box of canned sardines! \[caption id="attachment_1534" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![More fish.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180224_194114-600x338.jpg) More fish.\[/caption\]

Tapas for dinner
----------------

Don't worry, we didn't just eat the pastel de nata and canned sardines. We also checked out some modern Lisboa cuisine. One evening we went to a cute little restaurant called Taberna da Rua das Flores. It is quite small and only seats about 20 people. We made sure to arrive early so we could get a seat. Luckily our early arrival paid off and we managed to get a table; not long after they were having to turn people away and add them to a 40 minute wait-list. Our meal was fairly unusual, and quite tasty. We shared half-cooked tuna steaks, veal, and crab bao burgers. We don't eat a lot of raw fish, so the tuna steaks took a bit of getting used to. The veal was really tasty. However, the standout dish was the crab bao buns which literally looked like a crab. \[caption id="attachment_1535" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Mr Crab.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_20180226_184433-600x338.jpg) Mr Crab.\[/caption\] The crab bao buns actually had a whole tempura crab in the middle. Kimmie asked the waiter "can we eat all of it?", and the waiter replied "every bit!" It was delicious!

Final thoughts on the city of Lisbon
------------------------------------

Lisbon is an interesting city to wander around, especially when the sun is shining (our last day we had torrential rain). Alfama feels very rustic, and also quite run down in some areas. It was nice walking past the local markets, seeing tourists on tuk tuks, and orange trees weighed down with an abundance of fruit. We will not forget the beautiful mosaic tile work visible on every corner! We enjoyed the colourful buildings and transport - a pleasant contrast to London's dull mono-colour palette. Lisbon's a great place to try fresh seafood, as well as the naughty-but-nice pastel de nata. Many people say that you can't go to Lisbon without listening to some sorrowful Fado music. We did intend to listen to some, but the performances are always late at night and we were always too tired to wait up for it! Maybe next time, but to make up for it we watched some performances on YouTube! Next, we'll post about our day trip out to beautiful Sintra. Jase and Kimmie
