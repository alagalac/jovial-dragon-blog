Over the weekend we decided to pay a visit to Notting Hill.

A colourful neighbourhood
-------------------------

The area is quite affluent and we loved strolling past and admiring the pretty pastel houses. Many had huge private gardens hiding behind large gates. \[caption id="attachment_266" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A street of pastel houses.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neighbourhood-300x169.jpg) A street of pastel houses.\[/caption\]

The 1999 movie
--------------

Kimmie was keen to visit the movie filming locations from [Notting Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill_(film)). We tracked down the blue door, but The Travel Book Co was a bit perplexing. There is a bookshop in the area, but disappointingly the original one [closed its doors](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8718545/The-Travel-Bookshop-Notting-Hill-store-that-inspired-Hollywood-film-to-close.html) a few years ago. \[caption id="attachment_263" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Notting Hill blue door.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blue-door-300x169.jpg) The Notting Hill blue door.\[/caption\]

Portobello Market
-----------------

Some locals told us about this market and recommended that we check it out. It's a long street market. The majority of the stalls had food, antiques, and knick-knacks. We just "window shopped". When we got to the lower end of the road we stumbled upon [Acklam Village Market](http://www.acklamvillage.com/). The range of cuisines here impressed us – from Palestinian, to Afhani, to Cuban, to Jamaican! We vowed that we'd come back to sample some of these interesting cuisines! \[caption id="attachment_264" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Portobello Road Market.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/portobello-road-300x169.jpg) The Portobello Road Market.\[/caption\]

Goodbye pork pie
----------------

Jase decided that it was important for us to try a traditional British pork pie. We found a cute little butchery called [C Lidgate](https://www.lidgates.com/) that sold them. The butchers even had cute little traditional hats on! Kimmie had not tried a British pork pie before and was surprised it wasn't similar to a kiwi pie. It was served cold, had a thick crust, and a meatloaf-style filing. For dinner we bought one of their pre-made pies. It was lamb, leek, and apricot, and was delicious! \[caption id="attachment_265" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![C Lidgate Butchery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/butcher-300x169.jpg) C Lidgate Butchery.\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
