As you’ll have seen from our earlier posts, we recently travelled to Tenerife for Jase’s birthday. This is the last post on our trip to Tenerife, and provides an overall summary.

Finding accommodation
---------------------

Travelling to Tenerife, one thing we struggled with was finding accommodation. Around the south of the island most of the accommodation is resorts. The cheap ones were about £100 per night, but most of them were either very tired, or timeshare resorts in which you have to sit through sales presentations. The good resorts were more like £200 per night, which just didn’t seem worth it. For comparison, our flights were only £70 return with EasyJet. AirBnb wasn’t really an option either, since it’s technically illegal there, and the only ones available looked a bit dodgy and you had to make bank transfers to foreign landlords. After much consternation, Kimmie finally found a nice looking hostel called [La Tortuga](http://www.latortugahostel.com/homepage/) (The Turtle). We ended up staying there, and it was nice, friendly, and cheap! It was in a good location too. \[caption id="attachment_1449" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![La Tortuga Hostel.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tenerife_tortuga-600x338.jpg) La Tortuga Hostel.\[/caption\]

Sampling the Cuisine
--------------------

On our first day, we asked at the hostel where to go for lunch by the beach. They recommended that if we wanted cheap and cheerful we should go to a place called the [Orange Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/OrangeCafeTenerife/). Orange Cafe was a strange cafe, with a mix of local Canarian and Czech (of all things!) cuisine. We don't know why anybody in their right mind would be after hot stodgy Czech dumplings in the Canarian heat! We did however enjoy their delicious tapas, in particular the Canarian potatoes and garlic anchovies. They like to add garlic in their dishes. We ended up coming back to Orange Cafe at least four times to try as many options on the menu as possible! \[caption id="attachment_1451" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Canarian potatoes and octopus.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tenerife_potatoes-600x338.jpg) Canarian potatoes and octopus.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1458" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Garlic prawn tapa.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/garlic-prawns-orange-cafe-600x338.jpg) Garlic prawn tapa.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1459" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Garlic anchovies - Jase's favourite!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/garlic-anchovies-600x338.jpg) Garlic anchovies - Jase's favourite!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1457" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Who doesn't like sangria on a hot day?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sangria-orange-cafe-600x337.jpg) Who doesn't like sangria on a hot day?\[/caption\]

A birthday spa
--------------

Since our original stargazing plans weren't to be, we ended up re-jigging our holiday plans, heading to [Aqua Club Termal](https://aquaclubtermal.com/en/) spa on Jase's birthday instead. \[caption id="attachment_1452" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The outside of the spa.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tenerife_spa-600x338.jpg) The outside of the spa.\[/caption\] The spa had a 12 stage circuit which we managed to complete. The circuit consisted of lots of different activities such as a sauna, spa baths, a Roman steam room, buckets of icy water, aromatherapy sprays, and therapeutic showers. The circuit focused on the alternation between hot and cold water. Sometimes when the cold water hit us, it gave us a fright! The therapeutic showers were interesting as they had sprays that went up from our feet to our head, and which switched between temperatures randomly. Kimmie found the freezing cold plunge pool a shock to the system, but conceded that the hot/cold contrast did feel refreshing afterwards. Kimmie thought that the hardest part of the circuit was a station where you walk over stones in bare feet. Talk about challenging! We obviously need more practice walking on sand or stones. Kimmie's favourite activity was the flotarium - a pool with lots of salt that allows you to float! Jase's favourite activity was the swan neck shoulder massage jets in the main pool. Overall, the whole experience was very relaxing. We would recommend it!

Will we go back to Tenerife?
----------------------------

The weather was amazing, and a welcome break from the chilly few degrees in London. For this reason alone, we had a great time. \[caption id="attachment_1462" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying the sun.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sunbathing-tenerife-600x337.jpg) Kimmie enjoying the sun.\[/caption\] We also cannot fault the quality of the food, especially at the likes of the Orange Cafe! However, while we enjoyed our holiday, a few things would stop us from returning to Tenerife. The primary one being that the island caters mainly to retirees. We're not quite in that age bracket, so of course there were less activities that catered to us! Tenerife appears to be a destination that many British people return to year on year. We're not content to return to the same spot every year, as we like adventure - to see new places and try new things. As a "winter sun" holiday destination, the island had a very British vibe about it - supermarkets cater to British tourists and there are lots of quite touristy areas. Of course, we did not venture to the north of the island, so we are judging only on our experience of the south/south-west side. \[caption id="attachment_1461" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A home away from home for British tourists?
