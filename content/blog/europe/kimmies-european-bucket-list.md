Some of you noticed that Jase cheated a bit with his European bucket list by including  a non-European destination. Good spotting! :) I've never been to Europe before (other than when I was a baby, and that doesn't count) so I found it very hard creating a top 10 bucket list. There's too much to see and do! But, because Jase didn't provide me with specific parameters for my bucket list, I'm going to cheat in my own way by listing the 10 destinations I most want to visit and what I want to do there. You might notice that many of my ideas revolve around food...

My top 10 destinations
----------------------

### 1\. Spain

*   Eat tapas, drink sangria, be inspired by Antoni Gaudi’s architecture, and practice some Spanish while soaking up the vibes of Barcelona
*   Visit the [Alcázar of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_of_Seville), a UNESCO World Heritage Site
*   Go to a fiesta

### 2\. Greece

*   Watch a sunset over Santorini
*   Sail through the Greek Isles
*   See the Acropolis and explore the birthplace of democracy

### 3\. Italy

*   Hike the [path of the gods](http://www.positano.com/en/e/il-sentiero-degli-dei) in Positano
*   Toast the Amalfi Coast views with limencello
*   Eat delicious fresh pasta
*   Visit the Colosseum in Rome
*   Ride a canal and then go to a masked ball at the Carnival of Venice
*   See the devastation caused by Mt Vesuvius in Pompeii/Herculaneum

### 4\. France

*   Indulge in Paris by savouring something fresh from a bakery, checking out the Eiffel Tower and other nearby attractions, popping in to see some princesses at Disneyland Paris, and strolling around the awesomely themed [Parc Astérix](https://www.parcasterix.fr/)
*   Admire the rows of lavender fields in Provence
*   Drink some wine in Bordeaux (because Champagne is overrated)
*   Visit the hall of mirrors in the Palace of Versailles

### 5\. Iceland

*   Check out the famous [blue lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com/)
*   Watch the colours of the northern lights from [a bubble](https://www.buubble.com/) (even better, if I'm in Norway I could see the lights from a [see-through igloo](http://www.kakslauttanen.fi/en/)!!)

### 6\. Portugal

*   Stroll Porto's riverfront area in the evening when numerous cafés, bars, and restaurants open...and try some port of course!
*   Try a famous custard tart at [Pasteis de Belém](http://pasteisdebelem.pt/en/) in Lisbon

### 7\. Switzerland

*   Soak up the scenery in Geneva and have some cheese fondue

### 8\. Germany

*   Go to the Hannover Christmas Markets
*   Visit some gorgeous fairytale castles like [Neuschwanstein Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle)
*   See what's left of the Berlin Wall
*   If there's time, and if Jase will let me (he doesn't like rollercoasters...), then ride the coasters in [Europa-Park](http://www.europapark.de/en)

### 9\. Ireland

*   Go to a quaint pub in Dublin and listen to people speak in cool accents
*   Explore Cork and go for a [night kayak on Lough Hyne](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186600-d1603705-Reviews-Atlantic_Sea_Kayaking-Cork_County_Cork.html), perhaps paddling through some pretty bioluminescence plankton (we loved swimming with these plankton in Thailand!)

### 10\. Netherlands

*   Ride a bike along the canals in Amsterdam and visit [Anne Frank House](http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/)
*   See lots of colourful flowers at the Tulip and Flower Festival (Keukenhof)

Now, I realise I have not even touched any of the wonderful and exciting adventures to be had here in the UK! Again, there's so much to see, but here's the beginning of my UK list:

*   See a West End show
*   Spend the night in a castle somewhere
*   Visit the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland
*   Check out Stonehenge
*   Go to the natural hot springs in Bath
*   Visit Oxford or Cambridge university
*   Ride the rollercoasters at Alton Towers
*   Check out Westminster
*   Be posh and have high tea somewhere fancy such as the Orangery, Sketch, or Claridges in London
*   Visit Edinburgh and perhaps venture up into the highlands
*   Go to the Cotswolds and enjoy the villages and picturesque English countryside
*   NYE in London or Edinburgh (Hogmanay)
*   Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Festival

You might be thinking that my choices aren't very adventurous. Never fear – I'm also keen to explore many off-the-beaten-track places once I've ticked off these "big ticket" items! Kimmie
