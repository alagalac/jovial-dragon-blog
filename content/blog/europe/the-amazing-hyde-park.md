Today we explored the beautiful Hyde Park. It was an amazingly sunny day (for anyone who ever wondered, or who thought it was a myth – I can confirm that it is in fact possible to get quite sun burnt in London!).

Cruising around the park
------------------------

One of the things Kimmie really wanted to do in London was to cycle around Hyde Park. Due to the gorgeous weather, demand was high for the "[Boris Bikes](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles)" (nicknamed after Boris Johnson, who was the Mayor of London when the bike scheme was launched). There weren't any available at the first stand we went to. Luckily, we managed to find some at the next stand we stumbled upon. To ride a bike you pay £2. This allows you to use the bikes for the next 24 hours, so long as each time you take a bike you return it to a stand within half hour. It's a bit odd. It was glorious riding around the park. Very iconic and relaxing. There was also a range of different landscapes which kept things interesting! We just had to be careful not to ride in a "no bike" zone, as you can get fined for riding outside of the designated areas! \[caption id="attachment_364" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie was excited to ride around in Hyde Park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-bike-riding-300x187.jpg) Kimmie was excited to ride around in Hyde Park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_365" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Riding next to the road.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-kimmie-riding-300x169.jpg) Riding next to the road.\[/caption\]

The park's features
-------------------

### Wide open spaces

Hyde Park is a whopping 140 hectares! According to Wiki:

> the park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground.

Fancy that! We're very glad it's no longer a hunting ground, as many more people can enjoy it. The park is so big that at times it feels like you have the place to yourself. \[caption id="attachment_356" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lots of space in Hyde Park despite its popularity. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/open-spaces-hyde-park-300x169.jpg) Lots of space in Hyde Park despite its popularity.\[/caption\]

### The lake

It was really lovely walking beside the man-made Serpentine lake in the middle of the park. People also looked like they were enjoying rowing and pedal boating. \[caption id="attachment_361" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A good day for an ice cream.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-ice-cream-300x188.jpg) A good day for an ice cream.\[/caption\] We also saw some people exercising in other interesting ways... \[caption id="attachment_362" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A strange day to go skiing...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-skiing-300x188.jpg) A strange day to go skiing...\[/caption\]

### Wildlife

We saw squirrels and a wide variety of birds, such as swans and geese. A sign in the park showed that foxes are also present in the area. Kimmie is keen to see a fox, but we didn't see one today! \[caption id="attachment_358" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Swans and their adorable fluffy cygnets!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-swans-300x169.jpg) Swans and their adorable fluffy cygnets!\[/caption\]

### Pretty flowers and sculptures

We liked walking through the rose garden area. The flowers were pretty and so was the walkway which had pergolas and fountains. \[caption id="attachment_367" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The rose garden area of Hyde Park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-roses-300x169.jpg) The rose garden area of Hyde Park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_368" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A fountain in the rose garden, ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyde-park-rose-garden-statue-300x169.jpg) A fountain in the rose garden,\[/caption\] Nearby the park is the [Wellington Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Arch), which reminded Kimmie of Paris's [Arc de Triomphe](http://www.arcdetriompheparis.com/). This arch is surrounded by a few war memorials, including a New Zealand one. \[caption id="attachment_369" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Wellington Arch.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Wellington-Arch-300x187.jpg) Wellington Arch.\[/caption\]

### Special features

Hyde Park specially caters to horses! Yes, if you have a horse there is a special track around the path that you can use. :) \[caption id="attachment_370" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Hyde Park's horse track.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Hyde-park-horse-track.-300x169.jpg) Hyde Park's horse track.\[/caption\] The park also has lots of great picnic spots and areas for playing sports.   We love Hyde Park and will definitely return!
