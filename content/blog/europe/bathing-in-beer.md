We recently visited Prague. While there, Jase surprised Kimmie by suggesting one of Kimmie's favourite things - being pampered at a health spa. However, this was no ordinary spa. In this spa, you bathe in beer!

A beer-what now!?
-----------------

If there's one thing the Czech are the best in the world at, it's beer consumption. They've topped the per capita beer drinking stats for the past 23 years, and drink on average 142.4 liters of beer per year per person, this compared to New Zealand at 66.9 liters per person. It's no surprise then that they have places where you can bathe in beer. Technically you aren't bathing in actual beer though. Rather, they make a hot bath and then add hops and yeast to the water. Oh, and they provide unlimited pour-your-own actual beer from a tap while you're relaxing in the bath. \[caption id="attachment_1268" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Having a beer in the bath.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beer_inthebath-600x338.jpg) Having a beer in the bath.\[/caption\]

The procedure
-------------

We arrived at the spa slightly early. The staff were very organised and led us right into our own private room which contained two bath tubs and a bed of straw. The room was warm and cozy, and there were wooden soled sandals for our use. The staff must have done this many times, as they had the process down pat. In our room a lady quickly went through her spiel about the therapeutic benefits of the procedure. It was hard to follow what she was saying due to the speed in which she spoke and because she mumbled a bit. Once she had finished she started a timer, telling us that at a certain point the bubbles would stop in the bath and that is when we should move to the straw bed. \[caption id="attachment_1265" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The hops and yeast which was added.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beer_additives-600x338.jpg) The hops and yeast which was added.\[/caption\] A regular session is one hour long and we didn't want to cut into our beer-time. As soon as she left we locked the door and stripped off. There is no point wearing swimsuits unless you want them to smell like hops forevermore! While in the bath we drank beer, relaxed, and ate complimentary beer bread coated in some form of butter. \[caption id="attachment_1266" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our baths and the roaring fireplace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beer_baths-600x338.jpg) Our baths and the roaring fireplace.\[/caption\] The bath lasted 25 minutes. It was quite fun having the beer taps next to us to pour our own drinks, even if Kimmie isn't a fan of beer. There were two sizes of drinking jugs - the large was quite heavy and hard to hold! Once our time in the bath was up, we put sheets on the straw bed and moved onto it. It was nice laying in the warmth. \[caption id="attachment_1267" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our straw bed where we relaxed afterwards.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beer_bed-600x338.jpg) Our straw bed where we relaxed afterwards.\[/caption\]

Feeling good afterwards
-----------------------

The staff recommended that we didn't shower for a few hours after the spa to maximize the effect. Our skin was really soft afterwards and for the next few days. We also felt really relaxed. While this spa was definitely an experience and we're glad we tried it, we might stick to the less expensive conventional spas in future! Jase and Kimmie
