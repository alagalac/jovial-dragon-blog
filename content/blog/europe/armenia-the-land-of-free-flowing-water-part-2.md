Kimmie recently visited Armenia, a country not too many Western people get a chance to discover. In part 2, she covers her thoughts on the Armenian landscape and wildlife, Armenian people, some Armenian traditions, Armenian cuisine and dining culture, and personal safety and political unrest.

In part 3, she'll discuss what it's like to travel around Armenia, talk about her sight-seeing adventures, and as a final added bonus, briefly tell you what visiting an Armenian dentist is like!

The Armenian landscape and wildlife
-----------------------------------

I was lucky enough to experience beautiful weather while in Armenia. Blue skies, the occasional cloud, and warm weather. This made me want to get out and about and explore. With such great landscapes and in weather like this, Armenia definitely seemed like a great place to go hiking.

### Mount Ararat

The most striking and revered landscape feature near Yerevan is Mount Ararat (and its younger neighbour "little Ararat"), which stands out from the surrounding flat landscape. It is something to behold and admire. When there were clear blue skies, we had perfect opportunities to view this glorious mountain. At other times, the mountain was hidden by clouds.

### Am I in New Zealand?

I was surprised to discover that the Armenian countryside looks a bit like New Zealand. It has rolling green/yellow hills, mountains, and vast expanses of empty land. I even noticed the occasional sheep!

I enjoyed the fascinating rock formations on many hills, which were like shark teeth or ant hills erupting out of the soil.

\[caption id="attachment_1728" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The hills had mounds like shark teeth.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/anthills-armenia-600x337.jpg) The hills had mounds like shark teeth.\[/caption\]

Armenia, in its current geographical boundaries, only has one lake called Lake Sevan. You can find other lakes in "Western Armenia" (present day Turkey). While traveling around I noticed other bodies of water which can be easy to mistake for lakes, but are in fact water reservoirs.

#### Flora

Armenia has a wide range of colourful flora. I enjoyed the wild flowers, tulips, and blossoms. Who needs to go to Amsterdam or Japan when you can find these beautiful flowers in Armenia? I was also visiting at the right time of the year to see some wildflowers.

\[caption id="attachment_1718" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Poppies among other wildflowers.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/poppies-and-wildflower-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/poppies-and-wildflower.jpg) Poppies among other wildflowers.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1719" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Pretty pink flower buds.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/armenia-flowers-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/armenia-flowers.jpg) Pretty pink flower buds.\[/caption\]

#### Fauna

Armenia is also blessed with amazing fauna. I enjoyed watching red and black ladybird-like beetles.

\[caption id="attachment_1731" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![A black beetle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/beetle-337x600.jpg) A black beetle.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1730" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A red and black beetle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/beetle-armenia-600x338.jpg) A red and black beetle.\[/caption\]

One thing that stood out was the amount of birdsong in the air. It was truly lovely to hear so much music, and I hope the conservation work going on back in New Zealand will restore the birdsong to a similar level as in Armenia. There were many amazing birds to enjoy, such as swallows, a kind of falcon, stalks, and my favourite: the woodpeckers! The usual suspects were also there, such as sparrows and magpies.

#### Rubbish

While I reveled in the beauty of Armenia's natural landscapes, I was also upset by the amount of damage that humans have caused to the environment in the form of litter, dumped car frames, and ugly man-made structures such as pipes. Armenia's natural beauty should be treasured and protected; as with all other countries people should be taking better care of the environment. I also noticed many people burning rubbish in the countryside, which cannot be good for human health or the environment.

\[caption id="attachment_1727" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An example of the weird above-ground pipes that were all over the country.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pipes-aboveground-600x337.jpg) An example of the weird above-ground pipes that were all over the country.\[/caption\]

Armenian people
---------------

In general, I found Armenian people very warm, down the earth, and welcoming. They accepted us into their homes with hugs, air kisses, and a tables overflowing with food.

\[caption id="attachment_1739" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Dinner made with love.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dinner-armenia-338x600.jpg) Dinner made with love.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1740" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Dessert (and this wasn't all of it either!)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dessert-armenia-600x338.jpg) Dessert (and this wasn't all of it either!)\[/caption\]

I noticed that Armenian people do not have the same sense of time or punctuality as in some Western countries. Not a bad thing—life feels more chilled out—but it reminded me of what is known as "island time" in the Pacific.

Curiously, I saw many Armenian men smoking, but no women smoking.

As a pastime, some Armenian men appeared to enjoy lingering on the side of the road for some reason.

Armenian cuisine and dining culture
-----------------------------------

Staples of Armenian cuisine, which you can find in almost every restaurant and family home include:

*   different styles of bread (lavosh)
*   barbecued and non-barbecued meats either in chunks or minced
*   barbecued potatoes and mushrooms
*   cheese (of many different varieties including string cheese)
*   local wine
*   honey (I saw many beehives in the countryside)
*   fruit juice with preserved or fresh fruit (similar in taste to a fruit cordial, but with whole pieces of fruit such as apricot, cherry, and peach)
*   salads with tomatoes
*   stuffed dumplings
*   olives

Armenian cuisine is tasty, and I was especially partial to the barbecued potatoes. The seasoning set them apart – I think they may have used paprika? \[caption id="attachment_1743" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![Fish and tasty barbecued potatoes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fish-armenia-337x600.jpg) Fish and tasty barbecued potatoes.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1744" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cheese and more cheese.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cheese-600x338.jpg) Cheese and more cheese.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1745" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![Infused fruit juice.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infused-juice-armenia-337x600.jpg) Infused fruit juice.\[/caption\]

We always found there was far too much food. You will never go hungry when being entertained in Armenia!

It would be good, however, if Armenia branched out and welcomed a wider variety of cuisines, because the food became a little repetitive after a while. On our last night, we went to a Chinese restaurant and ate Chinese food. It was a welcome change!

### I'd like to make a toast...

At each meal, people around the table, young and old, made toasts. I was not expecting the sheer number of toasts. Sometimes we were toasting every few minutes! Unlike in Western cultures, it was acceptable to continue eating while people toasted. Most likely because otherwise you would have no time to eat!

At one meal, people made toasts thanking individuals, the people who could not be there, children, women, and more. It was also common for people to make multiple toasts throughout the evening. The amount of toasts seemed to correlate with the alcohol intake, so you can imagine that after a long meal many people are jovially tipsy or rather drunk. Drink driving does not appear to be a consideration, as people continued to encourage everyone to drink and kept trying to refill glasses!

### Wine

Who doesn't enjoy a glass of wine with dinner? Armenian wine is nice – interestingly I only saw red wine during my trip, so I assume this is the country's specialty. There was also pomegranate wine, which is a must try!

\[caption id="attachment_1746" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Some Armenian wine from Areni.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180403_185757-2-338x600.jpg) Some Armenian wine from Areni.\[/caption\]

A word of warning: on the dinner table watch out for any innocuously-looking unlabeled plastic bottles full of vodka. They are easy to mistake for water!

### Got a sweet tooth?

In general, I noticed that Armenians have quite a sweet tooth, with many desserts and sweets always on offer. When drinking tea, a fruit preserve in syrup is sometimes served as an accompaniment. I tried a cherry preserve and could not believe how sugary it was! I ate it to be polite, but otherwise I would prefer to drink my tea without this sugary treat.

\[caption id="attachment_1747" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some Armenian sweets.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/armenia-sweets-600x338.jpg) Some Armenian sweets.\[/caption\]

Traditions
----------

### Bread and salt

As part of the welcome we received when we visited a village, we were greeted by a girl offering us a circle-shaped bread (a bit like ciabatta). We were encouraged to tear off a small piece of bread and dip it in the salt before eating it. I made the mistake of thinking that the salt was a dip, and well and truly exceeded my salt intake for that day!

\[caption id="attachment_1750" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Sampling bread with salt in the middle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bread-armenia-600x337.jpg) Sampling bread with salt in the middle.\[/caption\]

### Dancing and music

In the villages girls danced for us in their traditional costumes. They generally danced in lines or circles to musical routines that repeated every few steps.

\[caption id="attachment_1751" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Girls dancing in traditional costume.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/village-dancing-armenia-600x338.jpg) Girls dancing in traditional costume.\[/caption\]

We also saw traditional music and dancing at some of the restaurants we visited (albeit, it felt more contrived). The dancing was either slow and elegant (the women use very graceful palm movements, similar in style to Thai dancing) or very energetic, and the music is often rhythmic and repetitive.

We were fortunate enough to receive a dance lesson, where we learned a few steps of three circle dances (there are hundreds of routines). In Armenia, people dance in groups, not with partners. The routines are short and can be picked up easily, but a little coordination and music sense is very helpful! My favourite of the routines basically required us to continuously hop and kick to the left and right.

I was also given the opportunity to try on a traditional dancing costume (it was a winter costume, and was therefore quite warm!). The crown is usually pinned down, and it can be adjusted using the Velcro at the back.

\[caption id="attachment_1752" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![Me wearing a traditional dancing costume.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/traditional-winter-costume-337x600.jpg) Me wearing a traditional dancing costume.\[/caption\]

I often asked the translators about the meanings of the songs, and found out that many Armenian songs are passionate and soulful.  I heard songs about relationships, the writer's love for Armenia, and others that reminisced about the past.

### Artistic talents

Many Armenians are creative (both boys and girls!). I saw traditional clay molding and scarf painting. From what I could see, there is much artistic talent in Armenia!

\[caption id="attachment_1759" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Interesting clay pottery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/clay-pottery-600x337.jpg) Interesting clay pottery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1758" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Samuel was pleased to receive his batik scarf gift.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/batik-scarf-600x337.jpg) Samuel was pleased to receive his batik scarf gift.\[/caption\]

### Easter game

It was around Easter time when I visited Armenia, and during this time I saw people playing a simple game with hard boiled eggs. Essentially, you hit the other person's egg, and whoever's egg cracks is the loser. I was surprised by the amount of joy and laughter that adults received from this playing simple game.

Personal safety and political unrest
------------------------------------

I did not feel unsafe during my visit to Armenia. Everyone was kind and I never felt I was being scammed (although, if you want to avoid higher tourist prices, bring an Armenian-speaking translator as they can barter on your behalf). We even left our car unlocked at times without fear of it being broken into.

While I did not experience any political unrest during my stay, there are tensions between Armenia and a few of its neighbours, and this tension did seem to linger in the air while we were in Yerevan. It felt as if the border was wide open and while it may appear paranoid, it felt as if an attack could occur at any moment.

One morning, at 4:00am, someone let off fireworks in Yerevan. I woke up and was alarmed at first, thinking that perhaps it was gunfire. However, luckily, it was just someone who considered that it a good time to let off fireworks.

The fireworks were especially visible through the sheer curtains. Apparently, regular curtains are unusual in Armenia and see-through curtains are likely a leftover relic from when Armenia was under Soviet influence.

### The Armenian Genocide

The Armenian genocide occurred between 1915 and 1917. Some countries have recognised it as a genocide while others have not, but there is an ongoing campaign to get them to do so.

I visited the Armenian genocide memorial and museum. There was an eternal flame which reminded me of the eternal flame that I visited in Hiroshima, Japan. It felt like a very quiet, reflective, and somber place.

\[caption id="attachment_1761" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The eternal flame at the genocide memorial.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eternal-flame-600x338.jpg) The eternal flame at the genocide memorial.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1760" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Looking at the memorial from afar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/armenian-genocide-600x338.jpg) Looking at the memorial from afar.\[/caption\]

The museum was fairly modern, and shaped a bit like a spiral. The museum told stories of what happened to the Armenians before, during, and after the genocide. Some parts are quite gruesome and it is terrible to think what the Armenian people suffered. The impact of these mass killings is still felt in Armenia today.

While this is a somewhat flat note to end on, and a rather solemn topic, I do hope that more people can learn about what happened in Armenia, and that relations between Armenia and its neighbours remain stable, or ideally, improve.

What's next?

I'll next discuss what it's like to travel around Armenia, talk about my sight-seeing adventures, and as a final added bonus, tell you what visiting an Armenian dentist is like!
