On Sunday it was a beautiful sunny day. We decided to check out the well-known Camden Market. It opened in 1974 with 16 stalls, and it now has over 1,000. The stalls are open 7 days a week.

Camden Town
-----------

Camden is in north-west London. It's basically London's version of Newtown (applies to both Sydney and Wellington). It's quite colourful and definitely not lacking in character. \[caption id="attachment_742" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Giant 3D shop signs are all the rage in Camden Town.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden2-600x338.jpg) Giant 3D shop signs are all the rage in Camden Town.\[/caption\] We noticed a lot of "alternative" shops there, which aren't really our scene. They specialised in fake brand-name clothing, tacky souvenirs, skulls, cannabis flavoured lolly pops, Gothic symbols and the like... \[caption id="attachment_741" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lots of places where you can get piercings or tattoos.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden1-600x338.jpg) Lots of places where you can get piercings or tattoos.\[/caption\] Being a Sunday, it was busier than usual, and the streets were completely full to the brim with people. Some opportunists took advantage of this. One hopeful guy badgered every person who walked past, trying to shove copies of his CD into unsuspecting hands. We found the crowds okay at first, but combined with the heat it became a bit overwhelming. \[caption id="attachment_740" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The main road in Camden Town.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden--600x338.jpg) The main road in Camden Town.\[/caption\]

Market food
-----------

We trotted over a bridge and encountered the huge variety of food stalls at Camden market. Kimmie decided she had found food heaven. So much choice! \[caption id="attachment_739" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![So many people wanting food!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/caden15-600x338.jpg) So many people wanting food!\[/caption\] We were hungry, so instead of circling the block to see what we fancied, we ended up trying the first few stalls which we stumbled upon. Being a hot day, we never would have picked Mac n' Cheese, but they were offering up free samples and we concluded that it was delicious! The stall offered several different flavours. We got their Mediterranean one with tomatoes and pesto, YUM! \[caption id="attachment_754" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying some great Mac n' Cheese!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden14-600x338.jpg) Jase enjoying some great Mac n' Cheese!\[/caption\] We also tried a bao bun which tasted nice, but it was tiny and the pork belly had too much fat on it. Then we decided to be adventurous and try some wild boar and wild venison Himalayan style dumplings! The dumplings were unusual, one type tasted cheesy (that's the problem with mixing up flavours, you have no idea what you're eating!). Kimmie starting eating the leafy side salad without realising it was raw kale. It was quickly spat out. \[caption id="attachment_752" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with her Himalayan dumplings. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden12-600x337.jpg) Kimmie with her Himalayan dumplings.\[/caption\] A cup of mango and lime homemade fizz was an awesome and very refreshing way to top things off! \[caption id="attachment_753" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Yummy refreshing homemade fizz.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden13-600x338.jpg) Yummy refreshing homemade fizz.\[/caption\] We also stumbled upon a range of bizarre foods which promise to cater to every diet and desire. For example, you've got the legs of ham for your cavemen/women, then you've got the fish n chip store for the Brits and Antipodeans, and you've also got your vegan burger shop. \[caption id="attachment_749" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jamon shop.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden9-600x337.jpg) Jamon shop.\[/caption\] Then there's all manner of desserts. What would you like? A crepe? Cake? Bubble waffles? A psychedelic bagel? Liquid nitrogen ice cream? \[caption id="attachment_747" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A wide range of doughnuts, including the psychedelic/unicorn bagel. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden7-600x338.jpg) A wide range of doughnuts, including the psychedelic/unicorn bagel.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_746" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A heart attack in frosting, anyone?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden6-600x338.jpg) A heart attack in frosting, anyone?\[/caption\]

Clothes, jewelry, and everything else
-------------------------------------

You can find artifacts, clothes, artwork, mosaic lamps, and even pounamu at the Camden market! It was fascinating to meander around. This market is quite large, but not as big as the likes of Chatuchak in Bangkok. We found the map painted on one of the walls very helpful for orientating ourselves! \[caption id="attachment_748" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A giant Elephant wall hanger.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden8-600x338.jpg) A giant Elephant wall hanger.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_744" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Unusual shorts and skirts.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden4-600x338.jpg) Unusual shorts and skirts.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_750" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Stalls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden10-600x338.jpg) Lots of things on offer - want a hammock?\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_758" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lots to look at.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden20-600x338.jpg) Lots to look at.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_751" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Tall statue in the middle of the market.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden11-600x338.jpg) Tall statue in the middle of the market.\[/caption\]

The canal
---------

Camden market straddles a canal, which makes for a picturesque setting.  We loved the huge willow trees that draped over the water and swayed in the breeze. We enjoyed watching the canal boats float by, and we were lucky enough to catch the ingenious [locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(water_navigation)) in operation! They lowered and raised boats from one part of the canal to the other. \[caption id="attachment_755" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Food stalls right next to the canal boats. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden16-600x338.jpg) Food stalls right next to the canal boats.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_756" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Locks in the canal.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden17-600x338.jpg) Locks in the canal.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_757" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![People posing on the bridge. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/camden18-600x338.jpg) People posing on the bridge.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

Camden market is awesome! We'll be back to sample more food, but perhaps on a day when it is less crowded. It was so busy that they closed the tube station due to overcrowding and we had to walk to the next one! Jase and Kimmie
