Before we arrived in Tenerife, we booked a stargazing adventure. We had read that the island is one of the best places in the world to observe the stars. 

A change of plans
-----------------

We looked through lots of different providers, and found one that was similar to the others, but cheaper. So we booked it excitedly.

Days went by, and we were enjoying our summer sun on the island. But then, while we were happily walking through Siam Park, Kimmie received a phone call to say that the tour had been cancelled due to low numbers! :( Jase was especially sad as it was meant to be his birthday activity.

Luckily, we managed to get a refund and we booked a similar tour, [Teide by Night](https://teidebynight.com/en/), with a different company for the day after Jase's birthday. It was more expensive (they also have far better marketing and a way nicer website), but we were willing to bite the bullet because we didn't want to skip one of the activities we were really looking forward to.

The journey begins
------------------

The tour bus picked us up at 14:30. We drove in silence for about an hour while the bus stopped to pick up  the other tourists.

After everyone was on board, our guide Fernando began to narrate the journey. He was very entertaining, often cracking jokes and telling us fun facts. One of the things he joked about was the fact that the volcano was due to erupt and that "it might be today or tomorrow, who knows?"

He also told us about the protected native Canarian pine. The pines are helpful for maintaining the island's aquifers, as water pools beneath them and then trickles underground through the porous pumice soil. The trees have also evolved to be fireproof - useful for that imminent eruption! We passed quite a few trees that had burnt black trunks as a result of fires from a few years ago, and which subsequently resurrected themselves and survived.

The bus took quite some time to navigate the long zig-zag road up the side of the volcano. It was interesting to see the different vegetation out the window, which changed according to the elevation and micro-climate. Some of the more memorable sights were the orange trees, wine vineyards, banana plantations, almond trees, cacti with prickly pears, and fields of potatoes.

It was magical when we drove high enough to be above the clouds. The bus didn't stop to allow us to take a photo, so you'll have to take our word for it. It was like we popped above a white fluffy blanket.

The bus stopped at a cafe in a little village. Fernando recommend that we try the homemade almond cake. We're not ones to snub a recommendation, so we took him up on his advice. The almond cake wasn't bad (although the almond cake we later had at Masca was better and it had a more rustic texture).

Photo ops in the park
---------------------

Over the course of the afternoon, the bus made a few more pit stops in Teide National Park (a world heritage site). The first was at a place with a rock formation called the Queen's Shoe. The rock kind of looks like a shoe, but other people say it resembles different objects and animals, such as a dolphin. At this spot we saw lots of birds darting between shrubs on the ground - apparently these are nicknamed "walkers", but they seemed more like "runners" to us!

We also saw Teide, the volcano.

The next stop, Cinchado rock, is apparently well known to Spanish people, and it's landscape was formerly depicted on the 1,000 peseta note (not used anymore due to the Euro). We walked up a few rocky hills and managed to get a few photos once some girls finally stopped being vain and talking a million photos of themselves!

Time to wine and dine
---------------------

It was now time for the sunset. We were dropped off at a viewing area (several other tour companies were there too). They gave us as much cava and—really nice—mulled wine as we wanted. We toasted the sunset as as the sun dipped below the horizon a large amount of fog rolled in.

Now that it was dark, it was time for dinner. Good thing too, since at that altitude alcohol affects people faster!

We were dropped off at a restaurant where we had a 3 course meal of soup, pork, and a chocolate sponge dessert. The food was fine, but not amazing. You didn't get any choice in the menu, and it was obvious that it was really mass-produced and not really fresh. The wine was pretty bad (our €3 supermarket wine was much better), which is unfortunate as it was all you could drink! We sat with a couple from Aberdeen, Scotland and two sisters from Finland. They were all fairly friendly.

Seeing the stars
----------------

After dinner we went back to the area with the Queen's Shoe and Fernando led the stargazing. It was really dark. The sky was so amazing as there was no moon glare, so even the faintest of stars could be seen with the naked eye.

Fernando had a green laser which he used to show us all the ways to find Polaris. This star indicates where North is.

The laser made it easy to see what he was referring to – it's range is pretty impressive! Due to the time of year, we were able to see constellations such as Taurus and Aries. It was interesting to find out that when it is your birthday you can never see your constellation in the sky as it is hidden on the other side of the earth!

It was a bit chilly during the star gazing, but we were given blankets and Fernando helped us forget about the cold with his interesting commentary.

Fernando told us that the area we were stargazing in is protected from light pollution. Planes have to divert around the area. He also told us about the projects underway to reduce light pollution so that more people can enjoy stargazing. For example, they are starting to use street lights in Tenerife that point downwards so that the light does not shine upwards into the sky.

Time to go home
---------------

After the stargazing, it was time to return to our accommodation. We arrived back at our hostel, La Tortuga, at around 10:30pm.

It was a long afternoon, but a really awesome one. We would definitely recommend this entertaining and informative tour, even if we were by far some of the youngest people on it! We rate it 8.5/10, with some marks lost due to the dinner and the length of timing spent picking people up and dropping them off!
