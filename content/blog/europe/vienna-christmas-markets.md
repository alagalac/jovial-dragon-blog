After Prague and Brno, we crossed the border into Austria, bound for Vienna.

The big yellow bus
------------------

Bright and early we jumped on a bright yellow double-decker bus (operated by the same company as the train that we took from Prague to Brno). [Regiojet](https://www.regiojet.com/en/) transfers are affordable and fairly nice, with an onboard food and drink service. Some of the complimentary offerings we couldn't make the most of, such as the newspapers in other languages. Overall, it was a fairly carefree few hours. Kimmie watched one of the only English movies she could find – _Ice Age: Collision Course_. \[caption id="attachment_1356" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Regiojet transfer from Brno to Vienna.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/regiojet-600x337.jpg) Regiojet transfer from Brno to Vienna.\[/caption\]

The snow is falling and it's a little chilly
--------------------------------------------

The ground was blanketed with snow in Brno, but we missed the actual sight of snow falling. No worries though, as Vienna made sure that we got to experience snowfall. It was rather magical. \[caption id="attachment_1355" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying the falling snow in Vienna.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kimmie-in-snow-vienna-600x338.jpg) Kimmie enjoying the falling snow in Vienna.\[/caption\] The sound of horseshoes clattering on cobblestones was common in the middle of Vienna. While very romantic and oldy-worldy, these days horse and carriages are merely put on for the tourists. In the tourist magazine that Kimmie read, it warned to look for horses that are well looked after. We hope that they don't treat them badly! \[caption id="attachment_1351" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some tourists enjoying a horse carriage ride.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/horse-carriage-vienna-600x337.jpg) Some tourists enjoying a horse carriage ride.\[/caption\] We enjoyed taking in the sights. It would be nice to come back in spring or summer to experience the rose gardens in full swing. \[caption id="attachment_1332" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Volksgarten rose gardens in hibernation.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Volksgarten-roses-vienna-600x338.jpg) Volksgarten rose gardens in hibernation.\[/caption\] So many of the buildings were majestic. We wished we'd had longer to breathe in the culture, tradition, and history that lingers in this place. A reason to return! \[caption id="attachment_1343" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Imperial Hofburg Palace area.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Imperial-Hofburg-Palace-area-vienna-600x338.jpg) Imperial Hofburg Palace area.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1333" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Burgtheater.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Burgtheater-vienna-600x323.jpg) Burgtheater.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1346" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Graben shopping area, festively decorated.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Graben-Vienna-600x338.jpg) The Graben shopping area, festively decorated.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1345" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![How much are those Mont Blanc pens?!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mont-blanc-600x337.jpg) How much are those Mont Blanc pens?!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1350" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View from the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jewish-memorial-vienna-600x337.jpg) View from the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1349" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Anker Clock.

Markets, markets everywhere
---------------------------

### Day markets

One reason we chose to visit Vienna was to experience the Christmas markets. We weren't disappointed. In fact, Kimmie felt she had found Christmas market paradise. The markets were scattered all over the town centre. We just had to turn any corner and we'd bump into another one. You might be thinking, sure, but they all sell the same thing right? Actually, the variety was quite amazing! \[caption id="attachment_1354" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Trying pistachio, bacon, and mozzarella arancini.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kimmie-vienna-market-600x338.jpg) Trying pistachio, bacon, and mozzarella arancini.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1353" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Beautiful christmas decorations on offer. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christmas-markets-vienna-decorations-600x338.jpg) Beautiful christmas decorations on offer.\[/caption\] One of the best things about the markets was the punch. So many drink options, so many different drinking vessels, and so lovely and warm. Cheers! \[caption id="attachment_1352" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Keeping warm with some delicious warm punch.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vienna-markets-kimmie-drink-600x338.jpg) Keeping warm with some delicious warm punch.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1344" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Gourmet taubenkobel fruit punch, made up of: white grape juice, lemongrass, vanilla pod, cloves, cinnamon stick, rum, white wine, amaretto, honey, spiced tea syrup, and lime.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mulled-wine-vienna-600x338.jpg) Gourmet taubenkobel fruit punch, made up of: white grape juice, lemongrass, vanilla pod, cloves, cinnamon stick, rum, white wine, amaretto, honey, spiced tea syrup, and lime.\[/caption\] In-between the day markets, we checked out a fancy supermarket. Supermarkets in other countries are always interesting to wander around! Kimmie bought some famous local pumpkin seed oil and marveled and the giant selection of lindt chocolate on offer. Jase got some meat chips, which he very much enjoyed munching on. \[caption id="attachment_1348" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase and his dried meat chips.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jase-meat-chips-vienna-600x337.jpg) Jase and his dried meat chips.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1347" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Closeup of the meat chips.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/meat-chips-600x337.jpg) Closeup of the meat chips.\[/caption\] We dodged the rain and its puddles to get to the famous Naschmarkt. Lots of spices and other unusual things were on offer, like the frog legs below. We didn't buy anything at this market, as we decided that it mostly sold items that we could find in London. \[caption id="attachment_1326" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Frog legs on offer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Naschmarkt-frog-legs-600x338.jpg) Frog legs on offer.\[/caption\]

### Night markets

Who knew that markets could be so enchanting at night? Kimmie fell in love - she was well and truly lost to the giant night market. The one we went to, [Christkindlmarkt at Rathausplatz](http://www.christkindlmarkt.at/christkindlmarkt-und-eistraum/), had hundreds of stalls. There were decorations in front of the market, such as a singing tree and a christmas present graveyard (or at least, that's what it looked like). The stalls were in front of an amazingly lit up backdrop, the Town Hall (called the Rathaus). There was a giant christmas tree in the centre of the market, and below this, music floated in the air from singing carollers. All of these aspects combined together to provide a very magical atmosphere. \[caption id="attachment_1339" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![ Christkindlmarkt at Rathausplatz.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xmas-market-large-vienna-600x338.jpg) Christkindlmarkt at Rathausplatz.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1341" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie in Christmas market heaven. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xmas-market-heaven-kimmie-600x338.jpg) Kimmie in Christmas market heaven.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1337" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Mesmerised by the various stall offerings. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mezemerised-at-market-kimmie-600x338.jpg) Mesmerised by the various stall offerings.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1338" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Carollers singing.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/carollers-vienna-market-600x337.jpg) Carollers singing.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1335" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Enjoying the magical markets.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/magical-markets-vienna-600x338.jpg) Enjoying the magical markets.\[/caption\] We tried a giant schnitzel in a bun. Oh my, it was delicious. Kimmie wanted to go back for seconds. Meanwhile, Jase enjoyed his GIANT baked potato with tzatziki (an unusual option which seemed to work!). \[caption id="attachment_1334" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase and his giant baked potato.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jase-giant-baked-potato--600x338.jpg) Jase and his giant baked potato.\[/caption\] We were amazed to even find an interestingly designed ice skating maze with a snowglobe in the middle. \[caption id="attachment_1340" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Ice skating maze.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ice-skating-rink-600x338.jpg) Ice skating maze.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1336" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Ice rink snowglobe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ice-rink-snowglobe-600x338.jpg) Ice rink snowglobe.\[/caption\] Needless to say, this market forevermore ruined Christmas markets for Kimmie, as it set an impossibly high bar for comparison. Is it possible to beat this Christmas market experience?

A time to be fancy
------------------

On our last day we went to the [Hofburg](https://www.hofburg-wien.at/) to view the silver collection, Imperial apartments, and the Sisi museum. It was a fascinating self-guided audio tour. Lots to see and be amazed by. Our eyes were like dinner plates just looking at all the intricately designed and expensive-looking dinner plates! The museum was huge - you could take the short or long silver collection tour. We decided on the short one but even that went on for ages! The story of Sisi's (Empress Elisabeth of Austria) life was quite fascinating, and it felt like a privilege to be able to walk around the areas where she lived and carried out her everyday tasks. \[caption id="attachment_1331" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Imperial gold crockery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/imperial-gold-crockery-600x338.jpg) Imperial gold crockery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1329" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Special crockery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crockery-pretty-vienna-600x337.jpg) Special crockery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1328" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![More amazing Imperial crockery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/crockery-imperial-vienna-338x600.jpg) More amazing Imperial crockery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1330" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A special napkin fold that apparently only two people have been trained to do.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/special-napkin-fold-600x338.jpg) A special napkin fold that apparently only two people in the world know how to do.\[/caption\] After visiting the Hofburg, we had lunch at the lovely high-class [Palmenhaus Cafe](http://www.palmenhaus.at/content/en/palmenhaus_en), which Kimmie had read about in advance. It was not false advertising either, we were in-fact surrounded by palm trees. There we were served warm soup and main courses. \[caption id="attachment_1327" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase drinking a very fluffy coffee at the Palmenhaus.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vienna-Palmenhaus-600x338.jpg) Jase drinking a very fluffy viennese coffee at the Palmenhaus.\[/caption\]

Final impressions
-----------------

Vienna is an amazing and beautiful city. In the few days we had to explore we only scratched the surface. Kimmie is keen to return, if for no other reason than to be immersed in next year's Christmas markets!

Thanks for being amazing, Vienna. We hope to return! Jase and Kimmie
