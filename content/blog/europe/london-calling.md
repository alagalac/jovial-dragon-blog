Hi everyone, Kimmie here. Welcome to our next blogging adventure! In January, we bought one-way tickets to London (departing May 7, 2017). This was a very emotional decision for us. We‚Äôd been talking about moving to the U.K. for several years. It was one of those topics that our friends probably got sick of us mentioning. They were probably sceptical about whether we‚Äôd ever actually do it. Fair enough too. We weren‚Äôt entirely convinced we would either. What made us finally take the plunge then? Well:

*   **we were flat hunting in peak season.** Who knew this could be so stressful for a full-time salaried couple? A lot of the time we did not even receive responses to our applications.
*   **we realised it was a good time to do it.** We are both under the age of 30 and have gained some life and career experience. We‚Äôre also without dependents or material commitments, such as a property with its accompanying mortgage. If we were ever going to do it, now was as good a time as any.
*   **Singapore Airlines had sale fares!** Who doesn‚Äôt love a good deal with an awesome airline??
*   **we wanted to broaden our professional skills and horizons.** It‚Äôs always good to challenge yourself and to gain new transferable career skills.
*   **we love adventure.** Moving to the U.K. should give us many new experiences and, if nothing else, an adventure. #YOLO?
*   **the internet told us we should.** It‚Äôs always wise to research your decisions before you make them. Googling can be dangerous and wildly unhelpful. But for this, it was very reassuring. Every blog or forum we encountered told that if we were on the fence to ‚Äújust do it‚Äù (man, whoever came up with that slogan for Nike is a genius).

Once we‚Äôd bought our plane tickets we went through a rollercoaster of emotions. These included:

*   Yay! We‚Äôve finally decided to move and we have a clear\[ish?\] plan.
*   Eek! We‚Äôve got one-way flights that are locked in! No turning back now.
*   Oh gosh. So much to do. So much to figure out. So many lists \[for Kimmie\] to write. How do we get a U.K. bank account? Where will we live? Will we be able to find jobs so that we are not poor? What British phrases and accents will \[mainly Kimmie\] have trouble understanding? Will we hate it, and resent spending so much time and effort on everything, only to come home early? When should we tell our work colleagues‚Ä¶?
*   GAH. WHY IS THE YOUTH MOBILITY VISA PROCESS SO CONFUSING!? Jase has a British passport so luckily does not need to get a visa. I on the other hand am not so lucky. (I wrote notes about my experience with the¬†visa process ‚Äì perhaps I‚Äôll share them on this blog someday. Give me a shout if you‚Äôre keen to read them!)
*   It will be hard leaving our lovely friends and work colleagues.

Oh, and fun fact: the day after we bought the tickets, I listened to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfK-WX2pa8c) on repeat for ages. üòä The clock is ticking ‚Äì it‚Äôs just over a month until we leave. We are very excited to share this next adventure with all of you. ~ Kimmie
