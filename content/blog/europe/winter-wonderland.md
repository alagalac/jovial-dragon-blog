The other week we checked out Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park with our friend Megan, who was over from New Zealand. Apparently, Winter Wonderland has been going strong for over 10 years, and it started as an open-air market. It now has ice skating, shows, roller coaster rides, street food stalls, festive bars, and live music.

Magical Ice Kingdom presents: Deep Sea Adventure
------------------------------------------------

There are several Winter Wonderland attractions that you can pre-book. We had no idea how busy things would be (turns out Wednesday evening in late November you're fine!), but for convenience and certainty we booked two attractions. The Magical Ice Kingdom was first. Essentially it was a walk-through attraction full of ice sculptures. Kimmie was expecting to be provided with warm clothes of some description (as with ice bars) but was disappointed when this was not the case! All the sculptures were beautiful and amazing. They were works of art that took a long time to carefully craft. But it just got so cold, to the point where we couldn't feel our hands anymore! If it weren't so cold we probably would have stayed longer. \[caption id="attachment_1228" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![A large and imposing ice sculpture.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ice-scupture-e1511943280190-450x600.jpeg) A large and imposing ice sculpture.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1233" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Amazing ice sculptures in an underwater theme.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Magical-Ice-600x450.jpeg) Amazing ice sculptures in an underwater theme.\[/caption\] There were some fun bits and bobs to discover along the way.

Cirque Berserk
--------------

The other paid attraction we went to was a circus full of human/mechanical stunts. All the acts were entertaining. A favourite was the contortionist - he left us both awed and disturbed! \[caption id="attachment_1219" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Riding a bike and dangling in mid-air.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-2-600x450.jpeg) Riding a bike and dangling in mid-air.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1220" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Swinging back and forth.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-3-600x450.jpeg) Swinging back and forth.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1221" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jumping and somersaulting in the air.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-4-600x450.jpeg) Jumping and somersaulting in the air.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1222" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Twisting and turning in suspension.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-5-600x450.jpeg) Twisting and turning in suspension.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1226" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Fire transformer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-600x450.jpeg) Fire transformer.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1224" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Contortionist doing his thing.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-7-600x450.jpeg) Contortionist doing his thing.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1225" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![He must be missing joints or something. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-8-600x450.jpeg) He must be missing joints or something.\[/caption\] You might be wondering what the orb in the background of these pictures is for. Well, it was used for stunt drivers who rode multiple motorbikes around each other. It was amazing that they managed to sequence it so that no-one crashed in such a small space! There were at least 4 - 6 speeding around at the same time. \[caption id="attachment_1223" align="alignnone" width="600"\]![Motorbikes in orb - at this point it also broke in two!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cirque-du-berserk-6-600x450.jpeg) Motorbikes in orb - at this point it also broke in two!\[/caption\]

Fairground and rides
--------------------

There was a nice range of rides to choose between, and both old and young were catered for. The adult attractions included roller-coasters, haunted mansions, a giant Ferris wheel, and other thrill rides. Megan and Kimmie had a great time on the silly-but-violent-corner-turning Wilde Maus. The majority of food options were German specialties such as sausages, but we also found polenta chips which made us happy! There was a variety of cold and warm liquor on offer - including a lovely warm red mead and festive mulled wine. We even stumbled upon a few _rotating_ carousel bars! \[caption id="attachment_1242" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A helter-skelter!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wonderland-600x450.jpeg) A helter-skelter!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1240" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Haunted Mansion ride.

While we definitely don't need giant tacky stuffed doughnuts or dog toys in our lives it was tempting to try and win a prize! \[caption id="attachment_1236" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase found some furry friends.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wonderland-3-600x450.jpeg) Jase found some furry friends.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

We had a great time at Winter Wonderland. There was a lot to do, much of which we need to return to try. The food selection could have been better, but that's not a biggie as we could always eat elsewhere. The evening atmosphere was nice and we of course had the lovely company of Megan (good to see you)! Jase and Kimmie
