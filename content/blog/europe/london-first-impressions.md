We've been in London for two full days now. Here are our first impressions.

It's gritty
-----------

Compared to little old Wellington the streets are leaner and meaner. There's a lot more rubbish around and our noses keep being assaulted by funky \[often unpleasant\] smells. There are also a lot of shady looking characters lingering around.

It's old
--------

London has a lot of old buildings. Some of the tube stations are really old and in desperate need of renovation! Mixed in with the old buildings are some brand new ones with unusual architecture. \[caption width="600" id="attachment_148" align="alignnone"\]![The Shard building among old brick buildings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/the-shard-169x300.jpg) The Shard building among old brick buildings.\[/caption\]

It has unusual weather
----------------------

We found the temperature unexpectedly chilly when we first arrived. It's meant to be the end of spring! In saying that, we have seen the sun! We've even experienced a t-shirt friendly day! \[caption width="600" id="attachment_151" align="alignnone"\]![Jase enjoying the sun at Hyde Park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hyde-park-300x169.jpg) Jase enjoying the sun at Hyde Park.\[/caption\]

It's grey
---------

When we first walked out of Paddington Station it felt like we'd just stepped into a black and white movie. The sun is not as bright here and the colours appear muted. Most of the buildings are stone, brick, or glass. However, there are pockets with beautiful green parks and gardens (a few are private and can't be accessed by the public).

It's also red
-------------

The famous red London buses, phone booths, and post boxes are everywhere! \[caption width="600" id="attachment_147" align="alignnone"\]![Kimmie and a post box.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/red-postbox-300x169.jpg) Kimmie and a post box.\[/caption\]

It's fashionable
----------------

You can go to Oxford Street for all of the fancy clothes you could ever want. When you stroll around the City of London you'll see lots of business men in suave suits. \[caption width="600" id="attachment_150" align="alignnone"\]![Fashion on Oxford Street.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fashion-300x300.jpg) Fashion on Oxford Street.\[/caption\]

It's compact
------------

It's quite easy to get around on the tube system, although it is a bit confusing at first. We noticed there are lots of mini supermarkets which don't have a wide range of stock. To see a decent sized supermarket you need to go into the suburbs.

It's bureaucratic
-----------------

A lot of stuff is more difficult than it needs to be. For example, Kimmie went to get a SIM card for her phone. You'd think this would be straightforward, but it turned out to be a bit of a hassle. She couldn't sign up to the majority of the phone plans for reasons like: "you need to be specially approved". The staff were also less than helpful. Then, once we had the SIM card, it was a mission to set up the voice mail. We had to resort to googling, but even then it was not obvious!

It's equine
-----------

We keep stumbling upon statues of horses...? \[caption width="600" id="attachment_146" align="alignnone"\]![The horse statue outside the Bank of England.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bank-and-horse-300x167.jpg) The horse statue outside the Bank of England.\[/caption\]

It's bike-friendly
------------------

There are a lot more cyclists here than back home. The traffic also seems to be much more aware of cyclists, with cars and buses watching out for them and giving them room. It's also easy to hire a bike, with bike stations all over the place, where you can rent a bike for Â£2. \[caption width="600" id="attachment_149" align="alignnone"\]![Bikes for hire.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bikes-for-hire-300x170.jpg) Bikes for hire.\[/caption\]

It's the little things
----------------------

The water tastes weird. We'd descibe it as soft. Jase and Kimmie
