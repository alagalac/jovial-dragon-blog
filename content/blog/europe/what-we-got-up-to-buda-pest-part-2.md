We enjoyed exploring both Buda and Pest, which definitely have different vibes. Here's Part 2, which is about our experience in Pest. If you'd like to read Part 1, [click here](http://coupleofkiwis.com/what-we-got-up-to-buda-pest-part-1/).

The pretty Pest riverside
-------------------------

We realise there's a riverside on both Buda and Pest, but we found the Pest waterfront more artsy and interesting. Its promenade is also lovely to stroll down in the evening.

### Art along the riverside

We enjoyed the creative statues, but we bet they are tripping hazards when it is dark (or someone isn't paying attention!). \[caption id="attachment_922" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Statue of a lady and a dog.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-riverside1-600x338.jpg) Statue of a lady and a dog.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_919" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Painting the bridge.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-riverside3-600x338.jpg) Painting the bridge.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_920" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Boy with Buda castle in the background.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-riverside2-600x338.jpg) Boy with Buda castle in the background.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_960" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Famous shoes on the Danube.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Shoes-on-danube-600x338.jpg) Famous shoes on the Danube.\[/caption\]

### The Hungarian Parliament

One of the most striking features of the Pest riverside is the Hungarian Parliament. Kimmie was keen to see inside the third largest Parliament building in the world, and [booked a tour](https://www.jegymester.hu/eng/Production/480000/Parliament-visit). Jase was lucky and got his ticket half price because of his British passport. What's it like inside? It's shiny, because the ceilings are covered in 22-23 carat gold! Only the parts of the building out of reach use real gold. They use fake gold on the lower walls so that people don't scratch off the real stuff. We also thought the artistic and intricate detail all over the walls, ceilings, and even under our feet was impressive. We were allowed to take photos everywhere apart from the room which had the royal jewels. Some interesting things we learned about the jewels:

*   No-one knows why the cross at the top of the [Holy Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Crown_of_Hungary) is bent!
*   The crown weighs over 2 kilograms! That doesn't sound comfortable.
*   It's rare for all of the lightbulbs in the chandelier above the jewels to be on at the same time. That's to protect the jewels from harsh lighting. They only put them all on for special occasions.
*   The crown was taken out of the country several times, and given to the US for safekeeping during the Cold War.
*   The crown was returned to Hungary by order of US President Jimmy Carter on the 6th of January 1978.

We found the Hungarian Parliament tour interesting, and would definitely recommend it! \[caption id="attachment_913" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View of the Hungarian Parliament from Pest. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parli-600x337.jpg) View of the Hungarian Parliament from the other side of the river.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_914" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Golden archways.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bug-parl-600x338.jpg) Golden archways.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_905" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Small golden cat figures. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl2-600x337.jpg) Small golden cat figures.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_906" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Statues of people along the walls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl3-600x338.jpg) Statues of people along the walls.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_907" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Amazing stained glass windows.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl4-600x390.jpg) Amazing stained glass windows.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_908" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Window with lots of detail.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl5-600x337.jpg) Window with lots of detail.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_909" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Impressive hallway.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl6-600x338.jpg) Impressive hallway.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_911" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Engraving on an archway and detail on the ceiling.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl8-600x338.jpg) Engraving on an archway and detail on the ceiling.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_912" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cigar slots which are no longer used.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl9-600x338.jpg) Cigar slots which are no longer used.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_910" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The debating chamber.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-parl7-600x338.jpg) The debating chamber.\[/caption\]

Architecture

### New York Cafe

The [New York Cafe](http://www.newyorkcafe.hu/) is marketed as the "most beautiful cafe in the world". This line attracts many tourists who are curious to see whether the title fits. When we arrived, we noticed that the cafe was full of tourists. Luckily, we only had to wait 5 minutes to get in, but we had perfect timing as the queue was out the door 10 minutes after we arrived. New York Cafe felt more like an up-market restaurant than a cafe, but perhaps that is how they secured their title? We only had drinks and dessert, which was perfectly acceptable. The waiters didn't pressure us to buy food. We were quite impressed by the opulence, and enjoyed the live piano music playing in the background. It was worth going just to experience this. It feels like New York Cafe is stuck in a time capsule and should only cater to royalty! \[caption id="attachment_931" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The glamorous New York Cafe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe-600x338.jpg) The glamorous New York Cafe.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_930" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The elaborate ceiling art.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe2-600x338.jpg) The elaborate ceiling art.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_929" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Fancy New York Cafe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe3-338x600.jpg) Fancy New York Cafe.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_927" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pretty details in New York Cafe. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe-5-600x337.jpg) Pretty details in New York Cafe.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_926" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A pretty staircase with red velvet trimming. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-6-600x338.jpg) A pretty staircase with red velvet trimming.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_928" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The talented pianist. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe4-600x338.jpg) The talented pianist.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_925" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Eating a strawberry and champagne sorbet at New York Cafe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ny-cafe-7-600x338.jpg) Eating a strawberry and champagne sorbet at New York Cafe.\[/caption\]

### Buildings that are art

We enjoyed strolling around the different neighbourhoods. The architecture continually changed. Not just the style, but there were stark contrasts between modern and decrepit buildings. \[caption id="attachment_932" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A pretty church at night. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-architechture5-600x338.jpg) A pretty church at night.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_933" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Vigadó tér.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-architechture-1-600x338.jpg) Vigadó tér.\[/caption\]

### Street art

Just like in Paris (and also back home in Wellington) we found interesting street art all over the place. The artists are quite talented! \[caption id="attachment_943" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Painting of a lady, located in front of a car park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-art2-338x600.jpg) Painting of a lady, located in front of a car park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_944" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Interesting art on the side of a building.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-art-600x338.jpg) Interesting art on the side of a building.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_949" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Penguins on an interesting house...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-art-street-338x600.jpg) Penguins on an interesting house...\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_961" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase walking through water.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-walking-through-water-600x338.jpg) Jase walking through water.\[/caption\]

Retro Pest
----------

We enjoyed stumbling upon some fun, quirky, and rather cool retro shops in Pest. There are many second hand and other bookshops, as well as second-hand clothing stores. One store Kimmie enjoyed perusing was [Szputnyik](https://szputnyikshop.com).

### Retro museums

We had the pleasure of spending time at the [Pinball Museum](http://www.flippermuzeum.hu/en/). You pay a fixed price and play for as long as you want! We got to try a lot of machines that we never normally would have played! There were also some non-pinball machines to play. If we had experienced a rainy day, we would have been keen to check out the [Video Game Museum](https://www.facebook.com/consolemuseumbudapest), where you get to play all the old-school consoles! Who needs regular museums, when you can have retro ones? \[caption id="attachment_941" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Video Game museum!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-retro-600x338.jpg) The Video Game museum!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_940" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Pinball Museum (also called the Flipper Museum).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-pinball-600x337.jpg) The Pinball Museum (also called the Flipper Museum).\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_939" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A few of their many pinball machines on offer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-pinball-2-600x338.jpg) A few of their many pinball machines on offer.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_938" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with an old pinball machine.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-pinball-3-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with an old pinball machine.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_947" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the alternatives to pinball.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-games-600x338.jpg) One of the alternatives to pinball.\[/caption\]

### Ruin bars

When people think of Budapest, they often think of ruin bars. After visiting a few we can see why they are so popular! They are cleverly designed, and a fascinating feast for the eyes. There is so much to look at and absorb.

[Szimpla Kert](https://szimpla.hu/) is the most famous ruin bar. It is a lot larger than we expected, and sprawls across many interestingly themed rooms.

\[caption id="attachment_948" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kuplung ruin bar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-ruin-bar-600x338.jpg) Kuplung ruin bar.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_956" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Leafy Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-600x338.jpg) Leafy Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_955" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Scribbles on the walls at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-2-600x338.jpg) Scribbles on the walls at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_954" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Disco room at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-3-600x338.jpg) Disco room at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_953" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase in an old bathtub at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-4-600x338.jpg) Jase in an old bathtub at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_952" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Interesting decorations at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-5-600x338.jpg) Interesting decorations at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_951" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Old technology at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-6-600x338.jpg) Old technology at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_950" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kangaroo at Szimpla Kert.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-Szimpla-Kert-7-600x338.jpg) Kangaroo at Szimpla Kert.\[/caption\]

Getting around
--------------

We found it easy navigating our way around Pest. Most of the time we walked because the terrain was flat and the city felt safe to wander around. We noticed that the drivers were very courteous to pedestrians, often stopping to let us pass. One thing you see a lot around Pest is tourists on segways and [monster rollers](http://www.budapestmadness.com/en/activities/monsterroller). Both look like a fun way to get around, but they aren't a cheap option! If we needed to get public transport we used the trams or the underground train system. These were both fairly straightforward. Most of the trams and trains we saw used old technology, but there was odd new one. We learned never to rely on the neon signs informing you of when the next tram is, as they appear to be inaccurate! One thing we found interesting about the underground train stations was that there were usually shops just before you got the escalators down. That's not the case with the London tube! We noticed the authorities are quite trusting with their ticketing system. They barely check you have a ticket (especially with the tram). We had already pre-paid for our transport, but I can imagine that many people got away without paying. \[caption id="attachment_958" align="alignnone" width="600"\]![Kimmie getting a tram.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pest-transport-600x338.jpg) Kimmie getting a tram.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

We loved Pest. It was an interesting place to explore, with an adventure waiting to be had around every second corner. Jase and Kimmie
