Kimmie recently visited Armenia, a country not too many Western people get a chance to discover. In this final episode, she talks about what it's like to travel around Armenia, some of the interesting sights and tourist attractions, and as a final added bonus, what its like to visit an Armenian dentist.

Getting around Armenia
----------------------

### English is gaining popularity, but is not widely spoken

I was lucky enough to travel with local Armenian-speaking hosts. I found that some people could speak basic-level English in Yerevan, but advanced knowledge of English was not widespread. Most people predominantly spoke Armenian or a language from a neighboring country, such as Russian. Therefore, I would definitely recommend having somebody to translate with you.

### Driving around in Armenia

Our only method of transport was by car, so I cannot comment on the public transport system. As previously mentioned, when travelling by car, you need to watch out for the many, many, potholes. Luckily for me, I was a passenger and therefore did not have to navigate them!

The poor quality of the majority of roads, coupled with the lack of trees, made Armenia very dusty. The dust really affected my throat.

Previously I also touched on the fact that Armenian drivers are, in general, very bad. I saw a lot of dangerous and uncourteous driving. Go figure really, as to get a drivers license in Armenia all you need to do is hand over some money. No written or practice tests required!

As a result of the poor driving skills, I saw many cars with scrapes, dents, and whole sections missing. Drivers demonstrated a lack of awareness and had no sense of danger. As in countries like Thailand, Armenians also do not appear to believe in seat belts!

Gas is common in Armenia, and the cheapest way to fuel a car. I was surprised to find out that the car I was travelling in was a gas/petrol hybrid instead of the electricity/petrol hybrids I am used to seeing. When fueling up with gas, we had to walk away from the car due to the possibility of explosion. Yikes!

It had recently snowed, and our car had to drive over icy patches. It is a definite skill to safely drive over ice, especially when travelling up or downhill. A shout out to our wonderful driver Yura, who safely ferried us between places despite obstacles such as ice, thank you.

Sight-seeing
------------

What is there to see and do in Armenia you say? Besides enjoying the landscapes with a glass of very affordable Armenian wine or cognac in your hand, there are many historical sites on offer.

We visited several monasteries, a fortress, and historical ruins. Armenia is mecca for history buffs! I'll quickly go through some of the places we visited.

### Erebuni fortress

Erebuni Fortress is an [Urartian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urartu) fortified city in Yerevan that was built in 782 BC. Its design has quite a Persian feel about it. There is an indoor museum to explore plus an outside area with wall and column ruins to look around. Not to mention, the fortress has great views over Yerevan! In its time, the fortress was an important political, economic, and cultural centre. Fun fact: the name "Yerevan" is apparently derived from Erebuni! \[caption id="attachment_1791" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Running horses outside Erebuni Fortress.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/horses-outside-Erebuni-Fortress-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/horses-outside-Erebuni-Fortress.jpg) Running horses outside Erebuni Fortress.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1790" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Winged statue at the foot of the steps up to Erebuni Fortress.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/winged-statue-Erebuni-Fortress-600x338.jpg) Winged statue at the foot of the steps up to Erebuni Fortress.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1789" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pottery and vessels for food.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pottery-at-Erebuni-Fortress-600x338.jpg) Pottery and vessels for food.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1788" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![Petroglyph rock painting on display.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/petroglyph-rock-painting-337x600.jpg) Petroglyph rock painting on display.\[/caption\]

### Etchmiadzin Cathedral

Known as the "mother" church of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is located in the city of Vagharshapat and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some people believe that Etchmiadzin Cathedral is the oldest cathedral in the world, with the original structure dating back to between 301 – 303. It was being restored while I was there, but I still got to see everything on the inside. !["<yoastmark](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/etchmiadzin-cathedral-under-construction-600x338.jpg) !["<yoastmark](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Etchmiadzin-ceiling-art-337x600.jpg) !["<yoastmark](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Etchmiadzin-chand-338x600.jpg) \[caption id="attachment_1800" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Clerical crown.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Clerical-crown-600x338.jpg) Clerical crown.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1804" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Etchmiadzin artifacts.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/etchmiadzin-artifacts-600x338.jpg) Etchmiadzin artifacts.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1806" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Khachkar stones.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Historic-khachkar-stones-338x600.jpg) Khachkar stones.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1805" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![Elaborate carved door.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Elaborate-carved-door-337x600.jpg) Elaborate carved door.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1808" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Nearby church of the Holy Archangels, near Etchmiadzin Cathedral.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Church-of-the-Holy-Archangels-near-Etchmiadzin-Cathedral-338x600.jpg) Nearby church of the Holy Archangels, near Etchmiadzin Cathedral.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1807" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inside the circular Church of the Holy Archangels.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Inside-circular-Church-of-the-Holy-Archangels-600x338.jpg) Inside the circular Church of the Holy Archangels.\[/caption\]

### Zvartnots Cathedral

Thought to be built around 650 AD by the Catholicos Nerses, this cathedral was destroyed in the 10th century. While the cathedral's demise is not known for certain, it is theorised that it fell into ruin in one of two ways:

*   Due to a large earthquake.
*   From Arab invasions – it is thought that the cathedral eventually collapsed as a result of the removal of stones.

These days, it is a lovely ruin to walk around, and it has a beautiful mountainous backdrop. I thought Zvartnots Cathedral was the most picturesque of all the sights I visited. \[caption id="attachment_1798" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Zvartnots Cathedral with the mountains in the background.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Zvartnots--600x338.jpg) Zvartnots Cathedral with the mountains in the background.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1796" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Zvartnots Cathedral from the side.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Zvartnots-1--600x338.jpg) Zvartnots Cathedral from the side.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1797" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Columns at Zvartnots Cathedral.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Columns-at-Zvartnots-600x338.jpg) Columns at Zvartnots Cathedral.\[/caption\]

### Khor Virap

Khor Virap is an Armenian monastery on the Ararat plain. Most notably, Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned here for 13 years by the king of Armenia. Gregory the Illuminator was the patron saint and first official head of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He is said to have converted Armenia from paganism to Christianity. Apparently, while imprisoned, he was kept alive by a Christian widow from the local town who regularly fed him by dropping a loaf of freshly baked bread into the pit. You can climb down a ladder into the pit where he lived. It's a popular thing to do, and there is often a line of people waiting to descend into the pit, especially as there is only one long ladder. The pit is not overly big, and it is fairly chilly! I can't imagine living there for so many years! \[caption id="attachment_1811" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Khor Virap monastery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/khor-virap-monastery--600x338.jpg) Khor Virap monastery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1814" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Armenian graffiti on the walls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Amenian-graffetti-600x338.jpg) Armenian graffiti on the walls.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1812" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Mari demonstrating how to go down a separate smaller hole in the monastery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mari-in-monastery-hole-600x338.jpg) Mari demonstrating how to go down a separate smaller hole in the monastery.\[/caption\]

### Noravank

Noravank is a 13th-century Armenian monastery perched on a hill in a gorge. It has interesting zig-zag steps that you can walk up and down, but they feel a little precarious! \[caption id="attachment_1818" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Surb Astvatsatsin in Noravank.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-600x338.jpg) Surb Astvatsatsin in Noravank.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1825" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Zig zag stone stairs going into Surb Astvatsatsin.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-with-zig-zag-stairs-600x338.jpg) Zig zag stone stairs going into Surb Astvatsatsin.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1826" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A view of the brick-red cliffs directly across from the monastery.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/view-from-noravank-600x338.jpg) A view of the brick-red cliffs directly across from the monastery.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1822" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cliff view from inside a window frame.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-window-frame-600x338.jpg) Cliff view from inside a window frame.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1824" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Intricately carved door at Noravank.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-door-338x600.jpg) Intricately carved door at Noravank.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1821" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Another interesting carved door at Noravank.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-door-2-338x600.jpg) Another interesting carved door at Noravank.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1823" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Bell hanging from the ceiling.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-bell-ceiling-338x600.jpg) Bell hanging from the ceiling.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1820" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Red candles burning inside Surb Karapet at Noravank.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/noravank-candle-600x338.jpg) Red candles burning inside Surb Karapet at Noravank.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1819" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Carved tombstones outside.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Carved-tombstones-outside-600x338.jpg) Carved tombstones outside.\[/caption\]

### Wings of Tartev

Wings of Tatev is a 5.7km cable-way to the Tatev monastery. It obtained the Guinness World Record for the "longest non-stop double track cable car". Usually, looking out of the cable-way, you can see lovely views of the gorge, however it was foggy when we were there. It gave the monastery an eerie vibe. An interesting fun fact I read while I was there, is that in 1920 the monastery declared a self-governing national state called "The Republic of Mountainous Armenia". This state existed for over six months! You can explore quite a lot of the grounds. At times I felt a bit daring and adventurous; it seemed strange that there were so many places without safety barriers. I bet some people have tripped or fallen into the holes in the ground by accident, or leaned over the windows a little too far. \[caption id="attachment_1832" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![The monastery in the fog.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_125549-338x600.jpg) The monastery in the fog.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1831" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![When this pillar moved it was apparently a warning of nearby enemies approaching. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_130229-338x600.jpg) When this pillar moved it was apparently a warning of nearby enemies approaching.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1830" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A funny sign at Tartev.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_133841-338x600.jpg) A funny sign at Tartev.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1829" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![After exploring Tartev I tried the interesting (and tasty) yogurt-based soup called "spas".

### Zorats Karer / Karahunj / Armenian Stonehenge

Zorats Karer is a mysterious, and still not fully understood, prehistoric archeological sight. At first glace, it simply looks like a field of stones in the middle of nowhere. Upon closer inspection, though, many of the stones have holes which people have theorised may have been used for astrological purposes. There are also ancient rock art in the area that depict flora and fauna, making this place an archaeologist's paradise! \[caption id="attachment_1837" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![I spy with my little eye...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_162200_HDR-338x600.jpg) I spy with my little eye...\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1836" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some of the holey stones.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_162418_HDR-600x338.jpg) Some of the holey stones.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1835" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![This scene really does remind me of the South Island of New Zealand.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180406_162625_HDR-600x338.jpg) This scene really does remind me of the South Island of New Zealand.\[/caption\]

### Caravanserai at Vardenyats Pass

These days there's not much to see at this shelter, but it is interesting to imagine that many years ago Silk Road traders rested here with animals such as camels. This place would be fascinating if it were preserved and somehow restored for people to see how it was formerly used. \[caption id="attachment_1839" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Caravanserai, built in 1332.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180407_110111-600x338.jpg) Caravanserai, built in 1332.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1838" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view over Vardenyats Pass.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180407_110146-600x338.jpg) The view over Vardenyats Pass.\[/caption\]

### History not your thing?

What if you are not a fan of visiting historical sites, gorging yourself with local food and drink, or enjoying the traditional arts and crafts?

For those who want to fully relax, there are thermal waters and pretty woods to explore in Jermuk. However, I found out that thermal facilities close at 5:00pm, so unfortunately I was unable to experience them for myself.

Armenia is still a developing country, but there are a lot of potential tourism opportunities which could be explored in the future. For example hiking, bird watching, the study of the country's geology (the cliffs range in colour from grey to yellow to red), stargazing, and horse riding. Even adrenaline junkies could find fulfillment through sports such as paragliding, whitewater rafting, and rock climbing.

Quality of dental care
----------------------

Okay, it's a bit of an odd area to comment on, but while I was in Yerevan I visited the dentist. I was quite nervous about going to a dentist in Armenia, because I had no idea about the standard of care. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the service I received, even though I didn't really know what was going on. The dentist could not speak any English, so I was very glad to have a helpful translator on hand!

I cannot speak for the standard of dentistry across Armenia, but I can recommend Tigran at [Kamar dental clinic](http://kamar.am/en) if you need to get your teeth checked for a reasonable price!

Final impressions
-----------------

I think what's particularly great about Armenia is it's unique culture and history. The dancing, music, interesting foods, and historical sights were all part of a wonderful cultural adventure which I very much enjoyed. Albeit, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it half as much, or navigate any of it very successfully, without the help I received from my Armenian hosts, translators, and drivers – for which I am very grateful!

The dust everywhere is one aspect I was happy to leave behind, as I am fairly sure it caused me to become sick.

I would have to say that one of the most amazing and intriguing things about Armenia for me is the ever-present drinking fountains. What a wonderful public resource this is!

As a developing country, Armenia still has a "diamond in the rough" charm. This makes it best suited to the more adventurous and intrepid of travelers. But, as Armenia becomes more accessible and increasingly open to tourists, this will obviously change. Speaking of change, I cannot conclude this blog series on Armenia without recognising the recent [2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution](http://2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution), which showed that change is in the air in Armenia, and ready to be embraced.

Thanks for the memories!
