We didn't think we would leave Barcelona as Antoni Gaudí fans, but it happened! His work is very inspired, and he had such an amazing imagination and sense of creativity. We wish that more architects would follow in his footsteps.

Gaudí-esque buildings
---------------------

While strolling the streets of Barcelona we stumbled upon a building that we thought was designed by Gaudí. Turns out that La Casa Comalat has "[some Gaudian semblance with the house Batlló](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Comalat)", so that's probably why we got confused. It is still a really interesting building, as you can see below. It looks like it is covered in blinds. \[caption id="attachment_1118" align="aligncenter" width="337"\]![La Casa Comalat from a distance.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/La-Casa-Comalat-2-337x600.jpg) La Casa Comalat from a distance.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1119" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![La Casa Comalat detailing. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/La-Casa-Comalat-600x338.jpg) La Casa Comalat detailing.\[/caption\]

Real Gaudí
----------

We also stumbled upon real Gaudí buildings while wandering around the city. The buildings stand out from their surroundings and are swarming with tourists. No wonder, because they are fascinating! \[caption id="attachment_1125" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Casa Milà.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_gaudi-600x338.jpg) Casa Milà.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1126" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Casa Batlló, the dragon-roofed building.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_battlo-600x600.jpg) Casa Batlló, the dragon-roofed building.\[/caption\]

Park Güell
----------

In Barcelona a few of the top attractions are so popular that you need to book tickets in advance. The tickets allocate you a very specific time slot for entry. If you miss your slot then it's possible you may have to purchase another one for another day (we didn't test this theory, but the conditions printed on our tickets sounded strict). We booked tickets for the paid-for section of Park Güell at the earliest time possible so that it wouldn't be too busy. This meant arriving for 8:00am! We weren't the only ones with this idea of course, and the place was still fairly busy. Park Güell contains a lot of interesting pieces of architecture designed by Gaudí. We liked what looked like gingerbread houses. It's too bad they are fairly empty and uninteresting on the inside. It's interesting that Park Güell was  originally designed to be a housing development area for wealthy people. In the end only two houses were built, and neither were designed by Gaudí. One was intended to be a show house, but on completion in 1904 it was put up for sale and did not sell.  Gaudí, at Güell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. He lived there until 1926. \[caption id="attachment_1127" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The gingerbread gate-houses.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_guell-600x371.jpg) The gingerbread gate-houses.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1128" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The pretty mosaics on the walls.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_pottery-600x338.jpg) The pretty mosaics on the walls.\[/caption\] Kimmie loved all the mosaic work everywhere. It was very pretty and we can only imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to piece everything together! While the paid-for section of the park was interesting, it was quite small and we weren't very keen on all the people. We felt that the rest of the park was nicer and more peaceful. It also had some interesting Gaudí works hidden among the trees. One thing we noticed about the park was a lack of wildlife. There was the odd bird and butterfly, but that's about it. \[caption id="attachment_1129" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Crazy birds nest pillars and beautiful gardens.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_pillars-600x338.jpg) Crazy birds nest pillars and beautiful gardens.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1130" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Looking back over Park Güell.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_park-600x338.jpg) Looking back over Park Güell.\[/caption\]

The Sagrada Família
-------------------

For Park Güell we had a 30 minute time slot in which to enter. For the Sagrada Família they were even more strict and we had to arrive within 15 minutes of the time on our ticket. Fortunately for us everything went well and we arrived with enough time to spare, even managing to sneak in a coffee at a nearby Italian cafe. The Sagrada Família is easy to spot. From afar, it doesn't blend in very well with its landscape. \[caption id="attachment_1137" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It's still under construction.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_construction-600x338.jpg) It's still under construction.\[/caption\] Construction on the Sagrada Família started in 1882, and as you can see it is still ongoing! Apparently it is scheduled for completion in 2026, although we'll believe it when we see it. They still haven't built the largest towers yet. The Sagrada Família is breathtaking up close. It's unlike any other building we've seen before and is by far the most spectacular church or cathedral we've ever seen. We had an audio tour, so we learned quite a lot about the building and the meanings behind everything. We were very impressed by how much thought has gone into every corner of the place. This includes the choice of stone based on its strength (different tree trunks in the church's inside "forest" were made of different stone). The design of the tree tops were chosen to best filter sound, and the colour of the glass is cool on one side and warm on the other, to emphasise the sun's rays at different times of day. \[caption id="attachment_1132" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The stained glass windows.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_glass-600x338.jpg) The stained glass windows.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1148" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Inside the amazing church forest.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dagrada-familia-338x600.jpg) Inside the amazing church forest.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1133" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The pillars which look like trees.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_treepillars-600x338.jpg) The pillars which look like trees.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1136" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It's turtles all the way down.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_turtle-600x338.jpg) It's turtles all the way down.\[/caption\] We paid extra to go up to the top of the nativity facade (the facade that Gaudí oversaw, and which is dedicated to the birth of Jesus). To get there, we had to go up a cylindrical elevator (which looked quite out of place) and by some stroke of luck we had the whole elevator to ourselves! The bridge at the top has us an awesome birds-eye view of the city. \[caption id="attachment_1135" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The dove sculptures have a good view.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona_pigeons-600x338.jpg) The dove sculptures have a good view.\[/caption\] As we wound down the spiral staircase it was fascinating to see the construction up close. \[caption id="attachment_1142" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Construction work.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gaudi-construction-600x338.jpg) Construction work.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1143" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![So many stairs!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gaudi-stairs-600x338.jpg) So many stairs!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1147" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Spiral staircase!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/spiral-stairs-gaudi-338x600.jpg) Spiral staircase!\[/caption\] On the way down there were several little balconies. They seemed a bit precarious, but we risked it for the view! \[caption id="attachment_1144" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase nervously enjoying the view. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gaudi-view-600x338.jpg) Jase nervously enjoying the view.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1145" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie admiring the towers.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gaudi-view-2-600x338.jpg) Kimmie admiring the towers.\[/caption\] Similar to when we were in Paris, we were disappointed to see graffiti on our way down. How can people do this to a building that is so beautiful? It should be treated with respect. You'll also notice the odd crack, which is a bit worrying. \[caption id="attachment_1146" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It was disappointing to see this.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/graffetii-600x338.jpg) It was disappointing to see this.\[/caption\] What's interesting about the Sagrada Família is that the outside detail is just as spectacular as the inside detail. It is hard to take it all in. \[caption id="attachment_1149" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Up close.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/detail-sagrada-600x338.jpg) Up close.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1150" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Three wise men.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/detail-sagrada-1-600x338.jpg) Three wise men.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1151" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Large and inclined columns, designed to resemble sequoia trunks.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/outside-sagrada-600x338.jpg) Large and inclined columns, designed to resemble sequoia trunks.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

Out of everything we did in Barcelona, the Sagrada Família made the greatest impression on us. It is a building we will never forget. We're not even Catholic, but you don't have to be to appreciate something so beautiful. We are already planning a return trip for when it is finished! :) Jase and Kimmie
