During our Czechia trip, we caught the early morning trainÂ through the snowy countryside from Prague to Brno, Czechia's second biggest city. Below are some of our trip highlights.

The country by train
--------------------

At the recommendation of our friend Kamil, we decided to take the train from Prague to Brno. He told us "On the train you'll see more of the countryside, and the countryside which they don't want you to see". We traveled on RegioJet, and so there was a big bright yellow train waiting for us at the station. It was hard to miss! The train ride itself was really nice and smooth. We were in a booth with four other people, which gave it a bit of a modern Harry Potter feel. Stewards regularly popped their head in and ask if we wanted anything. They spoke only in Czech, so we didn't really understand what they were saying. Somehow, instead of a coffee, Jase ended up drinking a mint tea with honey. \[caption id="attachment_1305" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The snowy countryside.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_country-600x338.jpg) The snowy countryside.\[/caption\] Rolling through the countryside we passed white fields of snow, picturesque villages, and forests with snow-covered trees. We also passed a lot of crumbling derelict buildings from soviet times. According to Kamil, they built these as a way to keep people busy during the communist times. They weren't built with beauty in mind. They are also located in the middle of nowhere.

The nice Castle Lednice
-----------------------

In Brno we met up with Kamil, who drove us to Lednice Castle. Lednice Castle is a grand UNESCO World Heritage listed palace set in the middle of beautiful park lands. \[caption id="attachment_1306" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The castle from the garden.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_castle-600x338.jpg) The castle from the garden.\[/caption\] We were super lucky with the weather. It had snowed heavily a few days beforehand. It was still very cold but the sun was out, which made everything bright and magical. \[caption id="attachment_1309" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The castle in the snow again.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_snow-600x338.jpg) The castle in the snow again.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1308" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The minaret, the tallest outside of the Muslin world at the time of construction.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_minaret-600x338.jpg) The minaret, the tallest outside of the Muslin world at the time of construction.\[/caption\] We went on a lovely walk around the grounds. The lake in the middle was mostly frozen. It was funny watching people feeding the ducks - which were slipping and sliding along the ice trying to eat the food. We had to be careful with our footing too as the path was very icy. \[caption id="attachment_1307" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Ducks sliding on the frozen pond.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_ducks-600x338.jpg) Ducks sliding on the frozen pond.\[/caption\]

Local Czech Cuisine
-------------------

After our walk, Kamil took us to nice local restaurant where we tried some local cuisine. \[caption id="attachment_1310" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The delicious pork and dumplings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_dumplings-600x338.jpg) The delicious pork and dumplings.\[/caption\] We hadn't heard much about Czech cuisine, other than it is hearty food. The food at this restaurant was delicious! We had a variety of different dumplings, sauces, and meats. Jase had a jug of Czech beer and Kimmie had white mulled wine, which she had never tried before. Just what we needed when it was zero degrees outside!

Monrovia wine
-------------

Our next activity was something special. Kamil's partner has a school friend who owns a small local vineyard. He gave us our own private wine tasting and tour! We went down into a wine cellar inside a converted mill. Our guide didn't speak much English (sweetly, he told us "my English is easy"), so Kamil served as our interpreter. It was a bit of a shame that we couldn't understand him as he was really nice, and apparently kept making jokes that didn't translate. \[caption id="attachment_1311" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Tasting wine in the cellar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_wine-600x338.jpg) Tasting wine in the cellar.\[/caption\] We tasted a huge variety of wines. Some of them weren't bottled yet, but our guide extracted wine directly from the barrel using an interesting glass device. He even shared some of their special family port with us. \[caption id="attachment_1316" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Extracting the unbottled wine.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_extracting_wine-600x338.jpg) Extracting the unbottled wine.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1312" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Tasting the good stuff under the rock.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_under_rock-600x338.jpg) Tasting the good stuff under the rock.\[/caption\] Definitely the best wine tasting we've ever been to. We took home a few bottles to share with Kamil and his partner. If only we had checked in luggage, then we would have brought bottles back to London with us!

The city of bones
-----------------

The next day Kamil took us on a tour of Brno. It was quite interesting to contrast Brno with Prague. Prague has a very pretty old town, but it is also much more touristy. Brno is more laid back and far less commercialised. \[caption id="attachment_1314" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_church-600x338.jpg) The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno.\[/caption\] Prague's Christmas market was not yet ready when we were there, but Brno's was in full swing. The mulled drinks were cheap, plentiful, and delicious. We tried warm pear, apple, grape, and also hot chocolate. They had an interesting system where you pay a deposit to borrow a glass and then you return it anywhere in the market to get the deposit back. We also tried a curious local specialty - a slab of cooked cheese with jam on top! \[caption id="attachment_1315" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Mulled wine at the Christmas market.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brno_market-600x338.jpg) Mulled wine at the Christmas market.\[/caption\] One of the more interesting sights in Brno is the Brno Ossuary. Only rediscovered in 2001, this ossuary holds over 50,000 skeletons. Piles of bones were stacked to the ceiling. Some of the skulls were artistically and tastefully arranged. It was fairly eerie walking around the remains of so many people, especially as many of the people would have been killed by the plague. Haunting music by a local composer was playing in the background, which helped to add to the creepy atmosphere.

Sauna World
-----------

To round off our time in Brno we went for a relaxing evening session at [4Comfort Sauna World](http://www.4comfort.cz/). As you may have noticed, Kimmie loves spas and pampering, however she hadn't been to many saunas and was not 100% sure how it all worked. It was quite fun going into the different sauna rooms. They were all different temperatures, and some of them had burning herbs which smelt lovely but really made our eyes water. Between the sauna rooms we went outside in the snow, or sometimes in the plunge pools to cool down. In classic Czech style, Kamil and Jase had a beer. Kimmie liked the warm relaxation room the best, where we laid back and listened to the gentle sound of fountain water trickling, while soaking in a light menthol aroma.

Leaving Brno
------------

All up we had a fantastic time in Brno. We were grateful to have had local guides, and we thank Kamil and his partner for their hospitality and for showing us a good time. :-) Jase and Kimmie
