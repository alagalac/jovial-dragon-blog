To escape the winter blues we caught a flight over to Palma de Mallorca in Spain to enjoy the warm sun.

Hiking to the wine
------------------

We caught the bus over to Esporles. The town was very sleepy, but quite cute. We bought some local mandarins from one of the shops. From there we started the Camí del Correu, a popular hiking trail. The route was originally a postal route created back in 1401. It winds through the mountains. The route was very peaceful, except for when a group of school children came up behind us!

After a few hours we arrived in Banyalbufar, a small village perched above the coast. The area was very popular with cyclists, and we saw a lot of them. We walked over to a winery called Bodega Son Vives where we stopped to sample some of their local wines and tried an antipasto platter made with olives from the trees right next to where were were sitting.

Our well deserved snack.

The lunch options in Banyalbufar were somewhat limited, and we didn’t want to spend a lot. We ended up going to a small pub where we were the only patrons. The man behind the bar cooked up some bar food which was alright. Jase decided that he liked the Spanish style fried peppers.

After a short walk to check out the coast we caught a bus back to Palma.

Citrus in Sollier
-----------------

When looking at things to do in Mallorca, Jase fell in love with the old-fashioned wooden train to Sollier. So we decided to take a day trip.

The train was originally built to transport all of the citrus fruit which Sollier was famous for, but these days is a tourist attraction. It was a fun ride through the mountains, and we stopped off at a lookout point high up in the mountains to get a good view of the Sollier valley.

The town of Sollier was also very cute. It was very scenic with the tram running through the square in front of the cathedral. It had a market on, and so we wandered around and tried some of the goods. We had a nice snack of a tomato and pork spread on toast. Outside the town you can see where Sollier earns its reputation for citrus. Every backyard had a small orange orchard, with big juicy oranges ripe on the tree.

Citrus trees everywhere.

We walked over to the small village Biniaraix where we stopped to have lunch and something to drink. From here we started walking up the Barranc de Biniaraix track into the mountains. It was very scenic with the terraced groves of olive trees, and goats with bells chiming off in the distance. We walked up for about half an hour before stopping for a break and to admire the view. Afterwards we climbed back down and made our way home.

A great place to cycle
----------------------

Our accommodation was located in the heart of Palma de Mallorca. We got a really good deal on it through a Black Friday sale. The location was great, much better than where some of our friends stayed in the more party/package holiday resort areas.

From our accommodation we hired a couple of bicycles. Mallorca has some great cycleways. We went cycling right the way around alongside the beach. It was great fun being able to pick up speed!

We cycled all the way to the end, and then stopped to splash in the water.

Craft Gin
---------

Kimmie messaged the local Mallorca Gin Distillery about their tours as they were closed on the day we wanted to do, and they offered us a private tasting! We turned up at the distillery, and there was one other lady there too. The owner made us gin and tonics, and taught us about the history of gin. He only charged us 10 euro for the experience, which seemed pretty good!

The Gin distillery was run by a British expat, similar to mistral Coffee Roasters which made some excellent coffees for us.

But it wasn’t just the coffee and gin that we enjoyed. We also had nice ramen, burgers, and local patries. We also went to a unique restaurant called La Juanita Cuina Fresca, where the owner creates a fresh new found course meal every night depending on what he finds at the market. He was very sweet, but didn’t speak much English. The food had lots of different and interesting flavours, and was a fun night out.

In Summary
----------

We had a great time in Mallorca. We were really glad that we stayed in the middle of Palma and avoided the package holiday resort crowd. We don’t think we would have liked that type of holiday!

Lots of people say that they don’t like Mallorca, but we would go back there again!
