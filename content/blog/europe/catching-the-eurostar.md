We bought [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com/uk-en) train tickets soon after arriving in London as we had heard that tickets are cheaper the earlier you book. Our tickets cost £45 one way and £39 the other. Sometimes you can be lucky enough to score tickets for about £29 one way (though, you might have to travel on weird dates). We timed our Friday – Monday Paris trip for when our friends were going to be there.

St Pancras International station
--------------------------------

### Getting to, and navigating through, St Pancras

We booked to leave London on a Friday evening so that we didn't have to take the Friday off work. Very useful if you don't have much leave. To get to the station, we left our workplaces on the dot of 5 and hopped on our nearby tube lines. Both of our journeys took about 15 minutes. It was surprisingly convenient. Finding our way to the Eurostar once we had arrived at the giant Kings Cross St Pancras train station was a bit trickier! It is huge, but we eventually located each other at about 5.30pm. We joined the very long queue. Our ticket said to arrive at least 30 minutes before the train's departure, and our train was due to depart at 6.30pm.

### The border control process

The first step was to scan our tickets at the automatic gates. That was easy enough. Next, we went through security. Kimmie's belt made the metal detector go off. Oops. She got a pat down as punishment. :/ We then had to show our passports at the British border control, and after that we had to go through the French border control. The French border control man stamped Kimmie's passport but didn't care about Jase's British one, handing it straight back. Jase was a bit jealous that he didn't get a stamp. All in all, it was a bit of a process and a little tiring to trundle through straight after work. From when we lined up for the Eurostar it  took about 30 minutes, so arriving the recommended minimum of 30 minutes beforehand would definitely be cutting it fine in peak time. We were glad to have peace of mind with extra time up our sleeves.

### Waiting to board

The St Pancras waiting area is quite large, but it was very busy when we were there. People were circling around trying to find seats. We were lucky enough to nab some after a few laps. \[caption id="attachment_573" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lots of people waiting for the Eurostar. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/St-pancras-600x337.jpg) Lots of people waiting for the Eurostar.\[/caption\] There were a few shops to look at in the waiting area, including one that sold Croque de la Mer. We'd seen Croque Madame and Croque Monsieur before but that was a new one. Not long before we needed to board there was an announcement saying that the train before ours was delayed. This had a knock-on effect making our train 40 minutes late. Not what you want to hear after a long day! We were also a bit concerned by the delay as our hotel said that it could not guarantee rooms after 11pm (strange considering we had pre-paid). Luckily, we managed to quell our concern by asking our friends who were staying at the same hotel to let the receptionist know about our train delay. Phew.

The Eurostar
------------

It was exciting to finally hear the announcement that our train was boarding. We were quite tired by that point and wanted to finish eating our picnic on the train (a picnic in the waiting area is not as fun...)! \[caption id="attachment_574" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with the Eurostar. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eurostar-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with the Eurostar.\[/caption\]

### Amenities

We found the train seats quite spacious. They also have foot rests and tray tables. \[caption id="attachment_575" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Happily in our seats.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/eurostar-onboard-600x338.jpg) Happily in our seats.\[/caption\] We tried to find power points but to no avail. After some Googling we found out that only carriages 5 and 14 have power points! So strange! We found the quality of the Eurostar wifi to be pretty average as the signal kept dropping in and out.

### The on-board bar

The person serving at the bar was very slow and inefficient. It was a long wait. Jase was upset when the people in front of us took the last Stella Artois. :( We suppose the wait was worth it for some evening wine. However, we decided that next time we would bring our own wine on with us. \[caption id="attachment_576" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![French wine from the bar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/eurostar-wine-600x338.jpg) French wine from the bar.\[/caption\]

### The journey

The train ride was quite smooth, but in comparison to Japan's Shinkansen it is a lot wobblier. On the Shinkansen you can walk around easily as it is very stable. On the Eurostar you have to navigate your way down the aisles carefully and try not to barrel into unsuspecting people in their seats. \[caption id="attachment_577" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A view of France from our window seat.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/eurostar-view-from-window-600x338.jpg) A view of France from our window seat.\[/caption\] The train journey took about 2.5 hours (although we ended up getting delayed by a further 15 minutes during the trip). The time went by fairly fast and we occupied ourselves by reading and watching movies. Due to the timezone change and the delays, we arrived in Gare du Nord, Paris at 11pm. \[caption id="attachment_580" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our first taste of French!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/eurostar-screen-french-600x337.jpg) Our first taste of French!\[/caption\]

### Getting to our accommodation

Our hotel was an easy 15 minute local metro ride away from Gare du Nord station which we were grateful for. We stayed in [Le Marais](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Le+Marais,+Paris,+France/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66e03cdce4ae9:0x38cfa580446f9e46?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyt-gwv_UAhVsIcAKHWNtDzAQ8gEIigEwDw), which we'll talk more about in a future post. The metro is fairly similar to London's tube and therefore was easy to figure out. Comparing the two, we think that the tube is nicer than the French metro, as the tube is cleaner and has less dodgy people lingering around. We also prefer using contactless cards to pay for trips instead of having to purchase paper tickets. \[caption id="attachment_578" align="aligncenter" width="424"\]![Paper metro tickets.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paris-metro-tix-424x600.jpg) Paper metro tickets.\[/caption\] One thing that is cool/creepy about the metro is the entrance lettering and strangely shaped lights. Looks like something from the Nightmare Before Christmas! \[caption id="attachment_579" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A metro entrance with the interesting font and street lights.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/metro-creepy-writing-600x338.jpg) A metro entrance with the interesting font and street lights.\[/caption\]

Returning from Gare du Nord to St Pancras
-----------------------------------------

### Chaotic and slow processes

At the end of our weekend Paris adventure (which we'll talk more about in subsequent posts) we arrived at Gare du Nord station at about 3.30pm for our 5.13pm train. We thought we had lots of time. However, the processes were much more disorderly and inefficient than at St Pancras. Security and border controls took close to an hour. Throughout the whole process the communication from staff was terrible and many passengers were confused.  Kimmie also had to spend some extra time filling in a UK arrival form. :(  Once we had gotten through the cramped and painful border control process we arrived in a waiting area. It was nowhere near as nice as the one at St Pancras.

### More delays

The train before ours was very delayed. Just our luck again! Strangely this time the delayed train didn't impact our departure. In fact, we boarded our train as the other train arrived at the platform. I would have been quite annoyed if I had been on their train.

Lessons we learned from traveling on the Eurostar
-------------------------------------------------

1\. It's good to arrive about an hour before your train's departure because delays are not uncommon. 2. The security and border processes are just as tiresome as airport ones. 3. The train ride itself is not too bad. It's pretty cool to be able to go from one country to another so easily. 4. Getting to and from the train stations is fairly simple. 5. We're thinking that perhaps next time it would be good to try a train that leaves from London in the morning because it was quite tiring to go through border controls after work.   Stay tuned for more Paris posts!
