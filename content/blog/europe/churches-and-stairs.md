Last Saturday we enjoyed our first full day in Paris. The sun was shining and the temperature was a hot 33 degrees! And so out we went adventuring about the city.

Notre-Dame Cathedral
--------------------

Early in the morning our first stop was the Notre-Dame Cathedral. \[caption id="attachment_587" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The front of the Notre-Dame.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/church-blocky-600x338.jpg) The front of the Notre-Dame.\[/caption\] We somewhat stumbled upon the cathedral by accident. It's located on an island in the middle of the Seine River. The cathedral is pretty easy to spot due to the two huge blocky towers out the front. The line to get inside was already quite long, but it was moving quickly so we joined it. There were a few dodgy men hanging about the area selling Eiffel Tower key-rings for inflated prices. When we finally reached the front of the line we saw a sign that you have to cover your shoulders. Unfortunately Kimmie was wearing a top which exposed her shoulders! She had to run to a small shop and quickly buy a €5 shawl before we were allowed in. \[caption id="attachment_589" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inside the Notre-Dame Cathedral.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/church-inside-600x338.jpg) Inside the Notre-Dame Cathedral.\[/caption\] Inside you could see the magnificent stained glass windows. Tourists were allowed to walk around the outside while people in the middle of the cathedral were praying. Behind the Notre-Dame is a small picturesque garden with a fountain. From the garden you can get a good view of the cathedral and admire the architecture, including the famous [flying buttresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_buttress) and lots of gargoyles. \[caption id="attachment_590" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The back of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/church-back-600x338.jpg) The back of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.\[/caption\] In the garden behind the Notre-Dame we had our first taste of the of the not-so-savory aspects of Paris. There were numerous scammers with clipboards hovering around. They come up to you and ask "Do you speak English?". If you say yes they try and convince you to sign a piece of paper on their flimsy pieces of cardboard. If you sign, they ask for a minimum of €20. We saw a lot of tourists giving them money. We however completely ignored them and didn't even respond.

Arc de Triomphe
---------------

From the Notre-Dame we walked over to the Arc de Trimophe. We could see the Arc in the distance so it didn't feel like we had far to walk. This proved to be a bit of an optical illusion, as the Arc is so big that it just looks close. \[caption id="attachment_643" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Arc de Triomphe in the distance.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-distant-600x338.jpg) The Arc de Triomphe in the distance.\[/caption\] The Arc de Triomphe is in the middle of an infamously busy roundabout, which would be suicidal to cross as a pedestrian. Fortunately they have a tunnel you can walk through to get to the middle. \[caption id="attachment_652" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Arc de Triomphe.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-close-600x600.jpg) The Arc de Triomphe.\[/caption\] The queue to buy tickets to climb to the top of the Arc starts inside the tunnel. The line itself was not very long when we joined. After about 15 minutes we were almost at the ticket booth and it was looking pretty good. Then all of a sudden they stopped letting people through and issuing tickets. We waited for half an hour next to the booth with no information about what the hold up was. An announcement finally came that there was a problem with the ticket machines. After waiting another 15 minutes Jase was ready to give up when they finally started selling the tickets again. We had to climb a lot of stairs to get up to the top, although at 284 steps it wasn't quite as bad as [The Monument to the Great Fire](http://coupleofkiwis.com/monument-great-fire/) in London. At the top there was an amazing view of Paris, with ten different streets leading off into the distance like spokes on a wheel. \[caption id="attachment_644" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view towards the Eiffel Tower.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-eiffel-600x338.jpg) The view towards the Eiffel Tower.\[/caption\]

Montmarte
---------

The next place on our agenda was Montmarte and Sacré-Cœur. The sun was really hot, so we decided not to walk there and instead use the metro. Upon existing the metro station in Montmarte we looked across the road and thought "Hey, that looks familiar!". We'd stumbled upon the famous red windmill of the Moulin Rouge. \[caption id="attachment_646" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Moulin Rouge.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-moulin-600x338.jpg) The Moulin Rouge.\[/caption\] From the Moulin Rouge we trekked up a hill, which, coming from Wellington, seemed like a familiar activity! We took the scenic route, and walked past a lot of very cute buildings and shops on our way. There were also some really nice looking pubs which would have been lovely to have stopped off at. At the top was the beautiful Sacré-Cœur church. \[caption id="attachment_647" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Sacré-Cœur.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-couer-600x338.jpg) The Sacré-Cœur.\[/caption\] We had a look around inside the church. It was very impressive, although it did perhaps pale in comparison to the Notre-Dame. Inside, there were some huge religious paintings on the ceiling. We couldn't take photos as there was a no photo policy. But this didn't stop some sneaky tourists. You were also meant to be quiet, but again some people don't really know how to be quiet - resulting in many "shush-ing" telling offs from staff.   After looking around inside, we decided to go up to the Dome. This involved hiking up 234 steps, because we hadn't had enough steps already! We were grateful for the seats and the gentle breeze at the top. The 360 degree view from the top was amazing. It was a shame that there was so much graffiti around the dome though. \[caption id="attachment_650" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view from the Dome.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-dome-600x338.jpg) The view from the Dome.\[/caption\] After climbing back down we'd had enough of churches and stairs for the day so it was time for a well deserved treat! We found this amazing gelato place called Amorino which crafted gelato into roses. We also opted to try out a macaron, because when you're in France you have to try such things. \[caption id="attachment_649" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie and her gelato rose with a macaron on top.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arc-icecream-600x338.jpg) Kimmie and her gelato rose with a macaron on top.\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
