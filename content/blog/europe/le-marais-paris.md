In this post, we describe [Le Marais](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Le+Marais,+Paris,+France/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66e03cdce4ae9:0x38cfa580446f9e46?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjctISo7Z7VAhWDKsAKHWd_CtEQ8gEImwEwDw), which is the Parisian neighborhood where we stayed during our trip to Paris.

Where to stay in Paris?
-----------------------

We did quite a bit of online research on where to stay. People strongly recommended staying within the city circle, and a few neighbourhoods were mentioned often: the Latin Quarter and Le Marais. We decided that we liked the sound of Le Marais, but soon found out that accommodation in the centre of Le Marais is quite expensive! Luckily, we found a [nice little hotel](http://www.campanile-paris-bastille.fr/en) on the outskirts which suited our needs perfectly!

The atmosphere
--------------

Le Marais is lovely to walk around. Many of the buildings have little balconies, and everything feels so quaint. There were a lot of small boutique stores with interesting products. We especially enjoyed wandering around early in the morning as it felt like we had the place to ourselves! \[caption id="attachment_662" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The empty early morning streets.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-600x338.jpg) The empty early morning streets.\[/caption\] So what do you do (other than dance in the streets of course) when you have the whole place to yourself? Well, we took note of all the places we wanted to go to later, such as a cute nearby boulangerie, and then went for a walk along the river Seine. It was glorious! \[caption id="attachment_661" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A nearby park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-3-600x338.jpg) A nearby park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_663" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Interesting bull in the wall.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-4-600x338.jpg) Interesting bull in the wall.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_664" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Famous falafel street in Le Marais.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-5-600x338.jpg) Famous falafel street in Le Marais.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_675" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A closed falafel shop.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marias-8-600x338.jpg) A closed falafel shop.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_660" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our local boulangerie (bakery).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-2-600x338.jpg) Our local boulangerie (bakery).\[/caption\] Of course, we had to try out the local coffee. It was quite bitter, and served very hot...! \[caption id="attachment_665" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Coffee at a pâtisserie.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-6-600x338.jpg) Coffee at a pâtisserie.\[/caption\] Le Marais is known for its quirky street art, which we found entertaining. \[caption id="attachment_669" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An example of local street art.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-9-600x338.jpg) An example of local street art.\[/caption\]

Nearby attractions
------------------

While there aren't that many big-name attractions in the area, we think that the neighborhood in itself is an attraction. It is also easy to walk to the Seine from Le Marais, as well as to Notre Dame Cathedral. If you're into museums, there are plenty in the area (including Musée Picasso!). We found Le Marais to be very well connected with the metro, and an easy ride from Charles de Gaulle Train Station. Therefore, it was a handy location in which to base ourselves. \[caption id="attachment_670" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Enjoying the river walk. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-10-600x338.jpg) Enjoying the river walk.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_673" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![It's nice to watch the boats pass by on the Seine in the evening. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-13-600x338.jpg) It's nice to watch the boats pass by on the Seine in the evening.\[/caption\]

The falafel-off
---------------

Le Marais is known for its falafels. Strange, right? Down Rue des Rosiers (which means "street of the rosebushes") there are several falafel shops. Two are opposite each other, and apparently have a long-held rivalry. We were keen to try the most famous one, L'As du Fallafel, but it was not open when we went (what food shop is closed on a Saturday night?!). So we went to their competitor instead! \[caption id="attachment_671" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase with our delicious mi-va-mi falafel pita pockets. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-11-600x338.jpg) Jase with our delicious mi-va-mi falafel pita pockets.\[/caption\] We really liked the falafel pita pockets. But watch out for the spicy red sauce! We ended up scraping ours off because it was a bit too hot.

When it rains, it pours
-----------------------

Okay, so obviously rain affects all parts of Paris. But check out how flooded it gets - the cycle ways become rivers! \[caption id="attachment_674" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A very flooded cycle way.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/le-marais-14-600x338.jpg) A very flooded cycle way.\[/caption\]

Verdict
-------

As we wandered around, we compared Le Marais with other areas such as the Latin Quarter (Monmarte you are so pretty!). We always found ourselves preferring Le Marais! What were the main things that we enjoyed about Le Marais?

*   Its tranquil and pretty surroundings
*   The character of the buildings
*   How well connected it is
*   Amazingly, it's not crawling with tourists!

We would recommend this area, and would definitely be keen to stay there again. Jase and Kimmie
