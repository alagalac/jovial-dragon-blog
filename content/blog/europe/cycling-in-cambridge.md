Over the Easter break we got up bright and early to catch a train to the university city of Cambridge.

Checking out the colleges
-------------------------

As soon as we dropped off our belongings at our Airbnb, we headed off to the city centre for a free walking tour. Our guide told us about interesting landmarks, such as the expensive 24-carat gold plated Corpus Clock. We were also told about the interesting examination techniques used by the university, such as putting people in groups and then randomly picking one person; that person's mark was applied to the whole group! Outside of the tour, we spent time walking through some of the colleges that make up Cambridge University. Interestingly, a few of the colleges have the same names as the ones at Oxford. Most of the colleges had something memorable about them, be it a pretty clock tower, King Henry VIII holding the leg of a chair, or a famous bridge. \[caption id="attachment_1617" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![The clocktower at Pembroke College. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180330_124008-338x600.jpg) The clock tower at Pembroke College.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1616" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The mathematical bridge at Queens' College.

At Magdalene College we saw that there is a specific wine list, and if you don't want to drink the wine on offer you have to pay corkage fees! The below notice gives you a bit of an insight into student life at Pembroke College (and the importance of cheese at dinner!). \[caption id="attachment_1630" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Noticeboard message at Magdalene College.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/noticeboard-mag-college-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/noticeboard-mag-college.jpg) Noticeboard message at Pembroke College.\[/caption\]

A cycle-crazy town
------------------

One thing we noticed about Cambridge is that bicycles are a very popular mode of transport. This is likely because the city and surrounding countryside are very flat. Cambridge city centre is also quite compact and doesn't have much traffic. Everywhere you walk you can see bikes propped up against buildings, in bike racks, or tied to railings. It must cause some disputes, as we saw quite a few "no bike parking" signs! \[caption id="attachment_1621" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A humorous anti-bike sign.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180330_111558-600x338.jpg) A humorous anti-bike sign.\[/caption\] We decided to join in on the action and hired some bikes to ride around the neighbouring countryside.

### Exploring Grantchester

We enjoyed the ride through the countryside of Grantchester, even though it started to drizzle in the afternoon. We passed lots of people walking dogs on the track beside the green fields with pheasants in the hedgerows. \[caption id="attachment_1622" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cycling alongside the swollen River Cam.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180331_143543-600x338.jpg) Cycling alongside the swollen River Cam.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1623" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cycling through the fields.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180331_141752-600x338.jpg) Cycling through the fields.\[/caption\] Grantchester is a small town outside of Cambridge. Apparently it's notable for having the world's highest concentration of Nobel Prize winners. \[caption id="attachment_1624" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The cute buildings with thatched roofs in Grantchester.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180331_141220-600x338.jpg) The cute buildings with thatched roofs in Grantchester.\[/caption\] We stopped off at a nice local gastropub called The Rupert Brooke for a delicious lunch. The sweet potato (kumara!) chips were particularly good! \[caption id="attachment_1626" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![A hearty lunch!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180331_130400-338x600.jpg) A hearty lunch!\[/caption\] Before heading back to Cambridge city centre, we stopped off at a local butcher to pick up a delicious steak pie for dinner. One strange thing that happened to Kimmie while we were out and about was that the key of her bike lock snapped. So, she couldn't actually lock her bike to anything for most of the day. In the end the hire company had to use an angle grinder to cut the lock off the bike!

Oxford or Cambridge?
--------------------

Oxford and Cambridge are both very pretty English cities with a lot of history and interesting old buildings. They feel a lot quieter in comparison to the hustle and bustle of London. They're both fairly student-oriented cities with lots of bicycles and good coffee. Our favourite coffee place was called Bould Brothers Coffee. \[caption id="attachment_1628" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Smashed avo and a flat white at Hot Numbers Coffee. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180330_115740-600x338.jpg) Smashed avo and a flat white at Hot Numbers Coffee.\[/caption\] They're both quite green cities with beautiful parks and rivers. \[caption id="attachment_1627" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pretty daffodils in the college grounds.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_20180331_160215-600x338.jpg) Pretty daffodils in the college grounds.\[/caption\] However, if we were forced to pick one of the two we would pick Oxford because we liked the grounds better, and enjoyed the Harry Potter filming locations. It may also be because we had an amazing Sunday roast in Oxford, and the weather was a bit better when we visited Oxford as well! \[caption id="attachment_1631" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A roast at the famous Eagle pub, where the discovery of DNA was announced.

Our thoughts
------------

We liked Cambridge, and felt it was a nice weekend getaway from the hustle and bustle of London. It was especially nice to enjoy the fresh air of the countryside by bike. Our visit to Cambridge actually by chance coincided with the funeral of Stephen Hawking, so its possible the town was busier than usual, but even still it wasn't super busy. Funny enough, before we visited Cambridge, many people had told us that they prefer Cambridge over Oxford. Strange that we lean more towards Oxford, but these things are obviously quite subjective! Jase and Kimmie.
