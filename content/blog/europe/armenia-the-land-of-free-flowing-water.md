Kimmie recently visited Armenia, a country not too many Western people get a chance to discover. In this post she compares urban Yerevan with the more laid back lifestyle in Armenian villages.

The city of Yerevan
-------------------

### First impressions of Yerevan

Many buildings in Yerevan have dubious-looking neglected exteriors, often with broken corrugated roofs. As in Lisbon, washing hangs over balconies and between buildings. The buildings are almost all made of pink or grey stone or brick, and, like in Thailand, support a huge mass of spaghetti-like cables.

\[caption id="attachment_1658" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![You can see the corrugated roofs and the pink stone buildings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yerevan-1-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yerevan-1.jpg) You can see the corrugated roofs and the pink stone buildings.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1659" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A view of Yerevan.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yerevan-2-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yerevan-2.jpg) A view of Yerevan.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1685" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A pink stone building with a vino inspired engraving.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pink-stone-building-with-motif-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pink-stone-building-with-motif.jpg) A pink stone building with a vino inspired engraving.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1673" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![An Armenian flag on a building.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/armenian-flag-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/armenian-flag.jpg) An Armenian flag on a building.\[/caption\]

At first glance, the buildings appear in a state of post-Soviet disrepair. However, I later learned that many buildings in Yerevan look unattractive on the outside but are lovely on the inside. The saying "don't judge a book by it's cover" is rather apt.

### Other observations I made while exploring Yerevan

*   There are many statues of famous men - more often than not the statues are made up only of their head.

\[caption id="attachment_1663" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A head statue in the middle of a roundabout.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/statue-roudabout-yerevan-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/statue-roudabout-yerevan.jpg) A head statue in the middle of a roundabout.\[/caption\]

*   I enjoyed the flower beds dotted around the city, which were primarily filled with blooming tulips.

\[caption id="attachment_1665" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Pretty tulips were all over Yerevan.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tulips-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tulips.jpg) Pretty tulips were all over Yerevan.\[/caption\]

*   Speaking of flowers, there are many roadside stands selling roses. Apparently Armenian men often buy women roses, which is nice!
*   There are a lot of interesting sculptures and artworks to stumble upon. \[caption id="attachment_1667" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![A sculpture with a large key.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/art-yerevan-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/art-yerevan.jpg) A sculpture with a large key.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1666" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![A statue of a man with a rose.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/art-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/art.jpg) A statue of a man with a rose.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1672" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Some artistic deer.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/deer-scupture-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/deer-scupture.jpg) Some artistic deer.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1671" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Interesting signs to other places around the world.

*   There are lots of decorative water fountains, although none were in operation during my visit. Strange considering the drinking fountains ran non-stop. :( \[caption id="attachment_1680" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![A dry water fountain in the city centre.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fountain-not-working-yerevan-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fountain-not-working-yerevan.jpg) A dry water fountain in the city centre.\[/caption\]
*   To my surprise, I discovered that there are many free-flowing continuously running drinking fountains in Yerevan. As I continued my travels, I came to realise that regardless of whether you are in the city centre, on the grounds of a monastery, or in a completely isolated rural place, drinking fountains are an ever present, common feature of the landscape. They really intrigued me, and I wondered whether the seemingly abundant supply of H2O was in fact so abundant. Is the water being wasted or recycled? Should the fountains be designed so they can be turned off? I would be interested to learn more. One thing is for sure, Armenia is lucky to have access to underground fresh and mineral water supplies. \[caption id="attachment_1699" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![One of the many drinking fountains in Yerevan.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/water-fountain-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/water-fountain.jpg) One of the many drinking fountains in Yerevan.\[/caption\]
*   Connected to my previous point, you can drink water straight from the tap. I was not expecting this, as in some developing countries it is unwise to drink straight from the tap.
*   You can buy pomegranate souvenirs for almost anything you can think of, be it mugs, magnets, t-shirts, pins, or scarves. I reckon Armenia could make a killing selling all manner of edible/drinkable pomegranate snacks (Armenian pomegranate jam, anyone?). \[caption id="attachment_1686" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Of course, I had to try some Armenian pomegranate juice (yum).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pomegranate-juice-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pomegranate-juice.jpg) Of course, I had to try some Armenian pomegranate juice (yum).\[/caption\]
*   You can still find remnants of history from the Soviet times. If you enjoy Soviet souvenirs, there are stalls specialising in this merchandise at the VernissageÂ Market, which operates over the weekend.
*   There are many monasteries and old graveyards to visit. All of the monasteries I visited had Armenian graffiti carved into the stone. They also had amazingly ornate doors. \[caption id="attachment_1701" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![We stumbled upon several weddings taking place at Zoravor Surp Astvatsatsin Church, the oldest surviving church in Yerevan.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Zoravor-Surp-Astvatsatsin-Church-wedding-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Zoravor-Surp-Astvatsatsin-Church-wedding.jpg) We stumbled upon several weddings taking place at Zoravor Surp Astvatsatsin Church, the oldest surviving church in Yerevan.\[/caption\]

Then of course I came across the odd random thing that made me do a double-take. Like a cafe operating from the boot of a van, for instance. \[caption id="attachment_1679" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Coffee, anyone?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cafe-in-van-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cafe-in-van.jpg) Coffee, anyone?\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1681" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![London burger!?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/london-burger-600x337.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/london-burger.jpg) London burger!?\[/caption\]

*   Not purely applicable to Yerevan, but the locals are horrible drivers! I saw so much dangerous driving, including some accidents. I saw cars overtaking into fast oncoming traffic, cars parking terribly and trapping other cars into parks, trucks and other vehicles carrying large loadsâincluding bouldersâcompletely unsecured. \[caption id="attachment_1692" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![We had to navigate out of tricky parking waters, after we got parked in.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/navigating-tricky-parking-waters-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/navigating-tricky-parking-waters.jpg) We had to navigate out of tricky parking spots, after we got closed in.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1691" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![A car did not have good spacial awareness, and scraped the side of our taxi.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/car-scrape-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/car-scrape.jpg) A car did not have good spacial awareness, and scraped the side of our taxi.\[/caption\]

*   As you can probably tell from the above photo, the city is very dusty. I think the dust is exacerbated by the poor-quality roads.

I wish I had been able to wander around Yerevan city more. It felt very untouched by tourism and therefore authentic. I am sure there is a lot more to stumble upon and discover. Yerevan is a mecca for travelers who want to explore somewhere new, interesting, and fairly "undiscovered" by the tourism industry, so get in quick, before it changes!. The only catch, as with all of Armenia, is that you'll most likely need a translator. According to the 2011 census only 3.6% of Armenians can speak English!

Village life
------------

We didn't just stay in metropolitan Yerevan â I also had the opportunity to visit several countryside villages. Some felt a lot more isolated than others.

\[caption id="attachment_1708" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Areni is a village in the Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia, and is known for wine production. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/areni-countryside-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/areni-countryside.jpg) Areni is a village in the Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia, and is known for wine production.\[/caption\]

On the way, in between the many potholes, I noticed there was a surprisingly large number of speed bumps. Apparently in Armenia they are known as "laying policemen"!

When we arrived at a few of the more isolated villages, it was as if time had stood still. The driveways and paths were mazes. Building constructions were very basic. The sound of roosters could be heard everywhere and the birds strut across the road without fear of being run over. I also saw small herds of cows grazing on the side of the road and being watched over by a minder with a stick. Children looked at on at us curiously as they played outside.

\[caption id="attachment_1707" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Some happy chickens in a village.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chickens-armenia-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chickens-armenia.jpg) Some happy chickens in a village.\[/caption\]

On side of road we also often saw people selling honey, preserved fruit, and other goods.

The country really felt more slower paced than the city, but both were quite fascinating. I'm glad I had the chance to experience different areas of Armenia, thanks to the drivers, translators, and trip organisers.

What's next?
------------

In my next post, I'll cover my thoughts on the Armenian landscape and wildlife, the Armenian people and some of their traditions, Armenian cuisine and dining culture, and personal safety and political unrest.

I hope you have found my observations interesting so far!
