Kimmie won 4 tickets to a [London Cabaret Club](http://www.thelondoncabaretclub.com/) show called "The Best of British Pop". We didn't know what to expect, but we couldn't really complain about free entertainment in London!

Who to go with?
---------------

We were lacking London friends to invite to the show, and the few friends we invited were busy. But we figured that surely someone would want some free tickets. So, we took a chance and advertised the tickets on a closed Facebook group. A nice girl about our age responded saying that her and her boyfriend would love to join us. It was a date!

Pre-show
--------

We were greeted by a nice lady at the entrance of the London Cabaret Club. She encouraged us to relax, order a drink from the bar, and enjoy the pre-show entertainment. Incidentally, the couple we were to meet were standing right in front of us in the line. So, we introduced ourselves and started chatting. The couple were really nice (phew!). It was such a relief to discover we weren't in for an awkward night. Kimmie tried the "show cocktail", which was a gamble as the bar staff wouldn't tell the waiter what the drink was! Luckily, it turned out to be a yummy lychee martini. We were surprised by the short beer list. There was one type of beer on offer: Heineken. Whoever made that decision should re-think it! Jase refused to order a Heineken, preferring to steal sips of Kimmie's martini instead. The ambiance of the waiting area was nice, with gentle music playing in the background. The saxophonist was particularly good.

The Best of British Pop

### Entering the ballroom

At 8.30pm we were led through into the ballroom. It felt cosy, glamorous, and _exclusive_. A beautiful chandelier hung from the ceiling. We were shown to our seats and were surprised to find ourselves seated at a booth in the very front! Our seats were right up against the stage – we could literally touch the actors if we wanted to! Amazing.

### The show

The show itself was made up of many little segments. From high-energy group dance acts, to ballerina solos, to everything in between. There was even an act where a giant dog came on stage and did some tricks with its trainer. I can't say we were expecting that one. \[caption id="attachment_698" align="aligncenter" width="451"\]![Right in amongst the action!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-16-451x600.jpg) Right in amongst the action!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_695" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![An actress in a bird-like costume.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-13-450x600.jpg) An actress in a bird-like costume.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_697" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![A very British set of costumes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-15-450x600.jpg) A very British set of costumes.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_696" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![These two were so talented and had amazing balance!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-14-450x600.jpg) These two were so talented and had amazing balance!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_693" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![About 8 women strutted around in giant feathery outfits.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-10-600x600.jpg) About 8 women strutted around in giant feathery outfits.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_694" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![This guy rolled around in a hoop.

Winners all around
------------------

During the night, the staff did a great job of attending to a bride-to-be and her hen party. The bride-to-be was sung to, invited up on stage, and sparklers were lit in her honour. Staff also collected prize draw entries from everyone in the room in-between the acts. The prize was a goodie bag with a bottle of bubbly, a variety of merchandise, and other items. By sheer luck, our table number was picked out of the hat for the prize; the girl in the couple we had just met had won! She accepted her award on stage, but not before having to dance for the crowd. We could tell that her boyfriend was enjoying every second... and filming it to enjoy again later!

The final act
-------------

Or so we thought. The MC made out as if the last act of the evening was about to perform. We got a surprise when more acts followed! The centre piece of the final acts was a topless, very buff, and very talented Russian aerial silk dancer. He started his act by washing himself in a bathtub. A rather unconventional start! \[caption id="attachment_686" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Washing up in the bath tub.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-17-600x450.jpg) Washing up in the bath tub.\[/caption\] After teasing the audience, he sprung into action by grabbing two suspended strands of silk. He flew around in the air, flicking water at the audience as he went. All the while presenting everyone with a very mischievous grin! That grin stole the hearts of the ladies in the audience, topping the night off perfectly. \[caption id="attachment_690" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![Swinging around like a monkey. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cabaret-4-450x600.jpg) Swinging around like a monkey.\[/caption\] After the conclusion of the final act, everyone was invited on stage to dance. We only stayed until about 11.30pm, but you're allowed to dance until 3am!

Final comments
--------------

We had a great time at the London Cabaret Club, and would go again. Which is good, because Kimmie won another 4 tickets to their other 007 Bond themed show _London Never Dies_. The main thing that we think should be improved is the table service, as the waiters were quite busy and took a while to fill orders. We also got charged for water, and the final receipt was not very clear. It's possible we paid for too many drinks just because we couldn't tell what was what. If our tickets weren't free we might have been inclined to more carefully inspect our receipt. All in all it was a fairly cheap and pleasurable night. We even managed to make some new friends!
