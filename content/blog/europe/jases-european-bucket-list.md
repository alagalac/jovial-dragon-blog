I haven't been to Europe since I was a kid, and that was only to the UK. While it is fun travelling as a child it isn't quite the same as when you travel as an adult. As a kid, you get shuttled around to wherever your parents want to visit. As an adult, you get to pick and choose where you want to go and what you want to do. Before we arrive in London, Kimmie and I thought we'd write down the top ten things we'd each like to do in Europe.

### Jase's Top 10

*   Experience Hogmanay in Edinburgh
*   Sail around the Greek Islands
