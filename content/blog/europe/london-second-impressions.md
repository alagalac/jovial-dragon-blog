We've been in London for over a month now and have made quite a few more observations since our [first impressions post](http://coupleofkiwis.com/london-first-impressions/).

Weather
-------

People like to talk about it. On the plus side, you can't really go wrong initiating a conversation about the weather. When we first arrived the question was: to umbrella, or not to umbrella? We didn't want to have to lug one around if we didn't need to, but for the first few weeks it was a good item to have handy. The sky was prone to opening up at any moment! \[caption id="attachment_530" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Sunny rainy, sunny rainy.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/to-rain-or-not-600x337.jpg) Sunny rainy, sunny rainy.\[/caption\] Many people warned us about how average the British summer is. We've actually been pleasantly surprised by how warm it has been. It has gotten too warm at times! This week it's been in the 30's, and we saw a girl faint from the heat the other day. \[caption id="attachment_536" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Enjoying summer while it lasts.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enjoying-summer-600x338.jpg) Enjoying summer while it lasts.\[/caption\] We are also really enjoying the sunny evenings – perfect for an after dinner stroll! Or an evening at London Zoo! \[caption id="attachment_514" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Unicorn entertainers at zoo nights.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/zoo-night-performers-600x338.jpg) Unicorn entertainers at zoo nights.\[/caption\]

The tube
--------

### It's hot and smelly

Speaking of the weather, it is WAY too hot at the moment to be cooped up in a train for 30+ minutes at a time. The temperatures have been 26°C+ on our tube line. In rush hour it is very hard to handle, with so many gross sweaty people packed into each relatively thin carriage... Eww...  The authorities are even advising tube users to bring a bottle of water and to exit the train if feeling faint! We wish they had air conditioning and wifi on the tube! It would make the commute so much nicer. Some of the deeper tube lines smell a bit like burnt rubber, and there is a serious lack of ventilation. The craziest tube station we've encountered is Moorgate. It has got so many stairs that it is as if you are going into the fire pit of Mordor!

### They aren't user friendly

We actively try to avoid some of the huge maze-like tube stations with dozens of escalators and exits. The vast majority of tube stations are also not disability, elderly, or tourists-with-huge-luggage friendly. There are no elevators. It was quite the mission lugging our stuff from one end of the city to the other. At least the new Docklands Light Rail (or DLR) is accessible.

### Being a smart tuber

We've discovered there's an art to the tube. The first trick is to know when your tube station is at its peak/off-peak time, so that you can adjust your travels accordingly (unless you enjoy cramped sweaty commutes). After work, Kimmie has to get to her tube station by 5.30pm, otherwise it is MAYHEM. The second trick is that you should carefully choose where on the train you stand (assuming you don't get a seat). If you stand in between the seats you have a lot more breathing room.

### Looking for the positives

Words we like to hear: "there is a good service operating on all London underground lines". The signage at tube stations is quite good. We always look to the coloured lines and tube maps on the walls to show us where we need to go. Kimmie particularly enjoys all the freebies outside the tube stations. There are often promotions where you can get free food and drink! They also have free newspapers (OK, they are pretty average, but at least they do have some content worth reading) and magazines (yay for free [Timeout](https://www.timeout.com/london) magazine!)

### Literal naming

Many tube stations have very literal names. Marble Arch Station has a marble arch nearby, Bank Station is where the Bank of England's HQ is, and you can find the monument to the Great Fire of London at Monument Station! It's not just tube stations that have literal names either, in Covent Garden there is a place called Seven Dials, and if you look up there are 7 clocks.

Cars
----

People seem to like their electric cars here. Which is good. It also means there are lots of electric vehicle charging stations. There are also a lot of really fancy cars (and not just in the richer areas). We've seen the likes of Aston Martins, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis just casually parked on side streets. One strange thing we've noticed is that people can park their cars in either direction (facing each other on the same side of the road). This seems dangerous, but it appears to work. \[caption id="attachment_515" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A Tesla charging.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Tesla-just-casually.-600x338.jpg) A Tesla charging.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_511" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A Ferrari, just casually. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ferrari-red-600x337.jpg) A Ferrari, just casually.\[/caption\]

Dogs live the high life
-----------------------

Dogs join people on the tubes, at cafes, and even pubs! It's a bit weird seeing dogs in these places. \[caption id="attachment_524" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Dogs on a train. Ha. Get it?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dogs-on-a-train-600x337.jpg) Dogs on a train. Ha. Get it?\[/caption\]

Parks and "greens"
------------------

We love the parks as they are relaxing. You may have noticed that we are a fan of their outdoor exercise areas! \[caption id="attachment_510" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying some rock climbing in the park. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/park-rock-climb-600x338.jpg) Kimmie enjoying some rock climbing in the park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_525" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying himself at the park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jase-park-fun-600x337.jpg) Jase enjoying himself at the park.\[/caption\] What's also interesting is that some parks offer chairs for hire. \[caption id="attachment_512" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Chairs for hire at Hyde Park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lodon-park-chairs-600x337.jpg) Chairs for hire at Hyde Park.\[/caption\] Many parks have ping pong tables. But it's BYO balls and paddles! \[caption id="attachment_516" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Ping pong, anyone?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ping-pong-table-in-parks-600x338.jpg) Ping pong, anyone?\[/caption\] Then there are these things called "greens", which are small patches of grass in suburban areas. I'm not quite sure what they are for as you can't do much on them. Some even have signs forbidding ball games! \[caption id="attachment_517" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Fun killers.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/no-ball-games-600x337.jpg) Fun killers.\[/caption\]

Banks
-----

Darn you UK banks and your stupid policies around setting up a bank account. Do you want my money or not!? Apparently not. While Jase got an account fairly easily due to his British passport, Kimmie found it far harder. After being rejected a few times for various reasons she put the idea on hold until she had her NINO and a letter from her employer. After about a month and a half, she was finally successful today! \[caption id="attachment_527" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A bank account is hard to obtain!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Llyods-Bank-600x337.jpg) A bank account is hard to obtain!\[/caption\]

The people
----------

London is very multicultural. Quite a contrast to back home. I didn't really notice it before, but Wellington seems quite homogeneous by comparison. We've been quite impressed by the generosity of Londoners. After the London and Birmingham attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire we noticed that so many people offered love and support. People raised money, donated clothes and other items, and gave their time to help those affected. But Londoners aren't just kind in times of darkness, they are kind everyday. Several people have helped Kimmie with her bags, offered her a seat, and offered us help when we have been confused.

The wildlife
------------

Compared to New Zealand pigeons, British ones sound like doves and owls. Their cooing is actually quite relaxing. Around dusk there is a HUGE group of rose-ringed parakeets that screech and fly from one tree to another at our local park. According to the park's website, up to 5,000 roost each night in the non-breeding season! \[caption id="attachment_541" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Look closely and you might see many many birds in the tree. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/birds-in-the-tree-600x337.jpg) Look closely and you might see many many birds in the tree.\[/caption\] We were very excited to see a fox the other day. We are now on the lookout for badgers. Yes, we know both are probably considered pests, but they are new and interesting to us.

Working life
------------

Every week both of our work places do a fire alarm test. For Kimmie, it's almost like being back at the New Zealand Parliament! Because it's so nice and warm at the moment, Kimmie enjoys having a picnic at one of the nearby parks during lunchtime. Very handy having parks nearby (Jase suffers from a lack of parks near his work, which is in the middle of a concrete jungle). Plain English. It's not so common here in the workplace. Alas – Kimmie is working on it one email at a time. She's even been encouraged to pursue plain English. Which is good, because excessive organisational acronym use is particularly horrible.

Things to see and do
--------------------

With so much variety, what do you prioritise? We have such a choice of events each weekend that it's not a question of what's on, but what should we choose?! See a play? Bask in the history of an ancient site? Stroll through one of London's many parks? How about a weekend escape to Europe? \[caption id="attachment_522" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One weekend we explored The Clink Prison Museum which is built on the original site of the Clink Prison (dates back to 1144).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the-clink-600x338.jpg) One weekend we explored The Clink Prison Museum which is built on the original site of the Clink Prison (dates back to 1144).\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_534" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Being silly tourists with a guard.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guard-pic-j-and-k-600x338.jpg) Being classic tourists with a guard.\[/caption\] Of course, you can find all sorts of strange and wonderful things just by wandering around. \[caption id="attachment_518" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We weren't expecting that.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tree-face-600x338.jpg) We weren't expecting that.\[/caption\]

Small but annoying
------------------

### Keyboards

We didn't know this before, but British keyboards are ever so slightly different to the US ones we use in New Zealand. In particular, the different position of the quote mark trips us up!

### Washing machines

We are lucky to not have our washing machine in our kitchen, but what's with that?! It's quite a common space saving trick here.

### Outside toilets

If you need to go to the toilet while you're out and about... sometimes you can be out of luck! Other times, you have to pay 20 or 50 pence to use a public toilet. This is quite annoying if you do not have change on you. However, if you know where to go (e.g. certain shopping complexes) then you can find free toilets!

### Paying for things

Contactless payments are more common here. You can even use your contactless card to pay for the tube. Despite how common contactless is, the shop assistants always ask before they paywave.

Food and drink
--------------

### Tea

The British love their tea. Kimmie was offered about 5 cups of tea on her first day of work. Even though she subsequently confessed her coffee preference, she is still offered tea all the time.

### Coffee

It's so hard to find good coffee here! We've found some that is okay, but definitely not up to Wellington standards. \[caption id="attachment_532" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![You can distinguish a hipster cafe from its merchandise.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hipster-coffee-cafe-338x600.jpg) You can distinguish a hipster cafe from its merchandise.\[/caption\]

### Pork

The pork products are much nicer here. With the bacon, there's also a wider variety of flavours. All of the bacon is smoked in New Zealand, whereas here you can get it un-smoked. Gammon is also quite common here, and it's something we didn't notice in New Zealand (we imagine it can probably be found in places such as Moore Wilson's though). \[caption id="attachment_529" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Woah, meat selection.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sausage-selection-600x338.jpg) Woah, meat selection.\[/caption\]

### Patriotism and localisation of food

A lot of food here emphasises its British ingredients. "British beef", "British grown asparagus", "British strawberries". We've also noticed some food from back home which is the same here but ever so slightly different. For example, WeetAbix. \[caption id="attachment_540" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Hmm... I swear I've seen this before. But wait! It uses Scottish raspberries!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/raspberry-yoghurt-600x337.jpg) Hmm... I swear I've seen this before. But wait! It uses Scottish raspberries!\[/caption\]

### Supermarkets

There's a huge variety of supermarkets compared to back home! When we first arrived and were living in the city centre we only went to the baby supermarkets, but now we live in the 'burbs our eyes have been opened. :) We've been to ASDA (basically a Walmart), Waitrose (Kimmie's favourite - it's posh and the food is of high quality), Sainsbury's, Tesco (better than Sainsbury's), Iceland (we avoid if possible), Morrisons... \[caption id="attachment_520" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We love you ASDA <3](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/asda-600x338.jpg) We love you ASDA <3. But not your terrible store layout!\[/caption\]

Rubbish and smells
------------------

### Clean vs dirty

In posh areas of London you won't find any rubbish. In fact, it's spotless. However in other areas there's litter everywhere. The other day we witnessed a guy blatantly throwing his sandwich wrapper onto the street. He didn't care at all. We also saw a group of people having a picnic in the park while completely surrounded by rubbish (not our idea of a fun/sanitary time!). Another thing we have noticed all over the place is Nitrous Oxide canisters. Bored kids use them to get high. Not a very clever idea as it can be dangerous! [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/29/laughing-gas-government-legal-highs-nitrous-oxide) talks about the issue.

### Charging for plastic bags

In the UK they have introduced a levy on plastic bags. Each time you need one at a supermarket it costs you 5–10 pence. This doesn't sound like much of a disincentive, but it seems to work. Lots of people (including us) take reusable bags to avoid having to buy them. We find it distressing if we are forced to buy bags because we do not have enough with us! This initiative was actually talked about in New Zealand, but it was not adopted.

### What is that pong??

The smell of marijuana is all over the place. It assaults us when we least expect it. Why is it so prevalent here?   Jase and Kimmie
