The other weekend we caught the train up to Oxford for a weekend getaway.

Getting there
-------------

We managed to score £5 train tickets to Oxford when [Great Western Railway](https://www.gwr.com/) had a sale. We were impressed that the sale included peak weekend times! On Saturday morning we caught an early train from London Paddington to arrive in Oxford around 10.00am. The trip was fairly quick at just over an hour. \[caption id="attachment_988" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Paddington Bear at the station.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pad-bear-600x337.jpg) Paddington Bear at the station.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_990" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![How to find out who has reserved a seat!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GWR-600x338.jpg) How to find out who has reserved a seat!\[/caption\]

Oxford City
-----------

When we exited the station, we noticed lots of chain stores such as Nandos. Not exactly what you think of when you think of Oxford. The architecture changed the closer we got towards the town centre. Around the town centre most of the buildings were old brick or stone builds. It was very quaint. \[caption id="attachment_993" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A main street in Oxford.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford-st-600x337.jpg) A main street in Oxford.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1002" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A quiet side street.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ox-street-600x338.jpg) A quiet side street.\[/caption\] We tried out a local cafe. Kimmie ordered an Italian hot chocolate. Kimmie has had Italian hot chocolates before, but she was quite surprised with what was served! The "drink" tasted like pudding sauce...and it was full to the brim! Her spoon could almost stand up in it! \[caption id="attachment_994" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An Italian hot chocolate!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ital-hot-choc-600x338.jpg) An Italian hot chocolate!\[/caption\] We enjoyed walking through Oxford University Parks, where we saw lots of squirrels and people jogging. We happened to stumble upon a chair plaque dedicated to someone we knew! \[caption id="attachment_1004" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Dedicated to J. R. R.

### A free tour of Oxford

Weekend getaways don't need to break the bank! We joined a [free 2-hour walking tour](http://www.footprints-tours.com/oxford-walking-tours/tours/2-hour-free-walking-tour/). Our guide Tom was great, and he even went to Oxford University! Probably hard to find anything more authentic. He told us about the life of an Oxford college student and also about the history of the area. While the tour was "free", they do ask for donations at the end. It's optional, but giving a token amount of money is only polite! \[caption id="attachment_1006" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our tour group "graduating" from Oxford.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/footprints-600x335.jpg) Our tour group "graduating" from Oxford.\[/caption\]

Interesting museums
-------------------

We had heard that the [Pitt Rivers Museum](https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/) was one to check out, and we're glad we did! It is exploding with wondrous items from around the world. It was like being in an Indiana Jones treasure trove collection. There were so many items, we think they need more space to display everything (although, the cluttered style was part of its charm). You easily need to set aside several hours to check out this collection. \[caption id="attachment_1030" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An amazing collection.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pitt-rivers-600x338.jpg) An amazing collection.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1031" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We noticed a lot of donated items from New Zealand.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pitt-rivers-2-600x338.jpg) We noticed a lot of donated items from New Zealand.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1032" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A range of old keys.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pitt-rivers-3-600x338.jpg) A range of old keys.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1033" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View from the third floor.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pitt-rivers-4-600x338.jpg) View from the third floor.\[/caption\] Next door to this museum is the Museum of Natural History. It was also good, but not as amazing as Pitt Rivers. Both were cheap, with entry by donation.

Magdalen College
----------------

Oxford University is a bit different from most universities in that it's made up of 38 different colleges, each of which is like its own mini-university. There are a lot of ancient rivalries between the colleges. Each college is responsible for teaching and housing its students. The first we visited was Magdalen College. It's a bit confusing to pronounce, as it's 'maud-lin'. \[caption id="attachment_1000" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Magdalen's Great Tower from the road.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/great-tower-oxford-600x337.jpg) Magdalen's Great Tower from the road.\[/caption\] Since we were early on the Sunday morning, the college was pretty empty and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. We enjoyed walking around the huge grounds, including a private deer park on an island in the middle of the river. \[caption id="attachment_1012" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Magdalen dining hall.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford-magdalen-hall-600x338.jpg) The Magdalen dining hall.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1016" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying the dining hall.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kimmie-ma-colledge-oxford-600x338.jpg) Kimmie enjoying the dining hall.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1010" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The deer park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford_deer-600x338.jpg) The deer park.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1021" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the tree stump seats.

They were bright green and very manicured, and had signs telling you to 'keep off the grass'. Apparently, the lawn at one of the wealthier colleges was looking a little brown from the sun and so they ripped it all up and replanted! \[caption id="attachment_1013" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The student accommodation at Magdalen College.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford-magdalen-600x338.jpg) The student accommodation at Magdalen College.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1017" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inner courtyard and statues. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ma-college-ox-600x338.jpg) Inner courtyard and statues.\[/caption\]

A traditional Sunday roast
--------------------------

Unfortunately because it was Sunday, Christ Church College's hours were reduced. They opened from 3.00pm instead of 10.00am. In the meantime, we decided to get out of the cold and enjoy a pub roast. We went to [Port Mahon](http://www.portmahon.co.uk/) and it was a good choice! Yummy food at a reasonable price! \[caption id="attachment_1024" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A hearty and warming pub roast!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pub-roast-oxford-600x338.jpg) A hearty and warming pub roast!\[/caption\]

Christ Church College
---------------------

Christ College is the most famous of Oxford's colleges. It's quite grand and has some lovely gardens. The dining hall at this college inspired JK Rowling's Great Hall in Hogwarts. There's also a famous staircase at the college which appears in the films. \[caption id="attachment_997" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The gardens at Christ College.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford-christ-college-600x338.jpg) The gardens at Christ College.\[/caption\] It was a beautiful day on the Saturday when we took the above and below photo. Unfortunately, when we returned on the Sunday it was cold and raining! \[caption id="attachment_998" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The visitor's entry to the college.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/christ-coll-600x338.jpg) The visitor's entry to the college.\[/caption\] Christ Church College was a lot more crowded that Magdalen College, which took away from the experience. We liked the serenity of Magdalen much better! \[caption id="attachment_1011" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Christ Church dining hall from Harry Potter.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oxford-christ-hall-600x338.jpg) The Christ Church dining hall from Harry Potter.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1025" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Female students would surely feel uncomfortable surrounded by all the paintings of stern looking men.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dining-hall-christ-coll-600x338.jpg) Female students would surely feel uncomfortable surrounded by all the paintings of stern looking men.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1026" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Look up!

Playing games to kill some time
-------------------------------

It's safe to say there's not as much to do in Oxford when it is raining! We did however manage to find a fun [board game cafe](http://www.thirstymeeples.co.uk/) which we enjoyed for several hours before we caught our return train to London. It was busy, and we got the last available table! We think there should be more of these in London! Playing board games is a great way to spend a rainy day. Jase and Kimmie
