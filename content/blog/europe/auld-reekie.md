A few weeks ago Kimmie had a work meeting in Edinburgh. We decided to head up earlier and make a holiday out of it so we could get a small taste of Scotland.

 A private tour of the city
---------------------------

Before we arrived, Kimmie spent some time researching the available walking tours. She found one that looked good, but it looked like it wasn't running while we were due to be there. Her heart was set on that particular tour, so she Facebook messaged the tour company. She instantly received an automatically generated message saying to call or text. So she texted. Amazingly, within a few minutes there was a reply! The tour operator said he wasn't planning on doing a tour that weekend, but that his wife is a kiwi and we could have a special private tour! How lucky were we?

### The tour

The tour started at Greyfriars Kirkyard, an old graveyard where J.K. Rowling apparently got her inspiration for some of the Harry Potter character names, such as Tom Riddle and Professor McGonagall. We were told of the story of Greyfriars Bobby, a dog who visited the grave of his owner after he died, although our guide doubted the authenticity of parts of the story! A lot of tourists pat the nose of the dog statue, thinking it brings good luck to do so. However, locals frown upon this - as you can see it damages the statue. \[caption id="attachment_1474" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The statue of Bobby the dog.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-bobbys-600x337.jpg) The statue of Bobby the dog.\[/caption\] A lot of the stories of the happenings in Edinburgh were quite gruesome and grizzly. Lots of murders and hangings! It was fun wandering through the old cobbled stone streets, lanes, closes, and wynds. Before parting, our tour guide gave us some useful tips for places to eat later. \[caption id="attachment_1478" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A colourful street near the castle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-3-600x387.jpg) A colourful street near the castle.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1480" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![There were lots of neat old buildings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-5-600x338.jpg) There were lots of neat old buildings.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1477" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A typical Edinburgh view.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-castle-1-600x337.jpg) A typical Edinburgh view.\[/caption\]

Holyrood Palace
---------------

We didn't pay to enter Edinburgh castle since we've been to a few castles, and from what we'd heard this castle isn't as spectacular as some of the others. You are able to walk around near the base of the castle and enjoy the view, which is what we ended up doing. As an alternative activity, we went to the other end of the "Royal Mile" to visit Holyrood Palace, where Mary Queen of Scots resided for several years. Today it is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. \[caption id="attachment_1481" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The front of Holyrood Palace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-entry-holyrood-palace-600x338.jpg) The front of Holyrood Palace.\[/caption\] Apparently the Queen only spends one week a year at Holyrood Palace. To be fair, we don't blame her. The palace is quite dark, gloomy, and cold on both the inside and outside. It's not a place we would want to stay for a long period of time. The audio tour was very interesting as it talked a lot about the history of the palace. We couldn't take any photos inside, but we got to see all of the rooms used by royalty, including Mary Queen of Scot's sleeping chambers. We also saw the spot where her friend Rizzo was murdered. Since we went in the late afternoon the palace gardens were already closed, so unfortunately we weren't able to wander around them (although we are sure they are more impressive in summer!). Instead, we wandered through Holyrood Abbey. We found it to be a very eerie and atmospheric ruins. \[caption id="attachment_1482" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The ruins of Holyrood Abbey.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-holyrood-600x338.jpg) The ruins of Holyrood Abbey.\[/caption\]

The Scottish Parliament
-----------------------

We could be classed as parliament nerds, having visited the New Zealand Parliament many times, and enjoying Budapest's grand parliament building. So while in Edinburgh we decided to book a free tour of Scotland's modern parliament buildings. The Scottish Parliament is fairly young, having been (re)established only in 1999. They didn't have a building ready for use initially, so an interim building was used while a brand new Parliament building was built near Holyrood Palace. The building is very non-symmetrical and arty. Many of the features in the building are symbolic. However, the architect died before the building was completed, so the meanings behind a lot of the features remain a mystery. \[caption id="attachment_1486" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The debating chamber.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-scot-parl-600x338.jpg) The debating chamber.\[/caption\] Jase correctly figured out that the images behind the glass in the debating chamber symbolise people, and not whisky bottles. The tour guide was impressed!

King Arthur's Seat
------------------

On one of the days we were in Edinburgh we were blessed with sunny weather. We decided to make the most of it and go on a wee hike. Edinburgh is quite a hilly city, which reminded us of Wellington. We started the walk to King Arthur's Seat from near Holyrood Palace. There were quite a few people around; it is obviously a popular walk. The path up the hill was very muddy! On many occasions we almost slipped and fell. But we didn't get away Scot-free (excuse the pun!), as our shoes became completely covered in mud. Part-way up the hill we stopped by Saint Anthony Chapel, which is just a ruin these days. It was very picturesque high up on the hill overlooking a lake. \[caption id="attachment_1487" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Saint Anthony's Chapel perched on the hill.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-7-600x338.jpg) Saint Anthony's Chapel perched on the hill.\[/caption\] The top of King Arthur's Seat was very windy! But we had an awesome 360 degree view of the city and surrounding countryside. We scrambled down the rocks to the other side of the hill to eat lunch. It was a lot more sheltered there! \[caption id="attachment_1490" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view from the top.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-arthurs-seat-2-600x338.jpg) The view from the top.\[/caption\]

Haggis everywhere!
------------------

We should probably have expected this given it is the national dish, but haggis is quite common in Edinburgh. While in Edinburgh, Jase had haggis with poached eggs for brunch, haggis and pork rolls for lunch, and vegetarian haggis on toast for breakfast. The haggis up in Edinburgh tastes quite good. Vegetarian haggis seems to be popular - it has a similar taste but the advantage that its contents are more palatable to think about...! \[caption id="attachment_1476" align="aligncenter" width="401"\]![Can you get more Scottish than this poster?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/haggis-burritto-401x600.jpg) Can you get more Scottish than this poster?\[/caption\] When we weren't eating haggis, we visited some really nice restaurants. Our favourite was called [The Outsider](http://www.theoutsiderrestaurant.com/). The restaurant serves modern Scottish food, and as a bonus comes with a nice view of the castle. \[caption id="attachment_1473" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view of the castle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-2-600x338.jpg) The view of the castle.\[/caption\] Coming from London, lunch seemed very reasonably priced (about £21 for a decent lunch for two people with alcohol and a bread platter for a starter). Kimmie had a venison pie, while Jase had a pan fried sea bass. The quality of everything was top notch! \[caption id="attachment_1472" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with her venison pie.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-outsider-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with her venison pie.\[/caption\] We liked the place so much that we ended up coming back another night for a romantic candle lit dinner. \[caption id="attachment_1483" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase's pan-seared hake.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-outsider-2-600x338.jpg) Jase's baked sea bream.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1484" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie's lamb wellington dish.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ed-outsider-3-600x338.jpg) Kimmie's lamb wellington dish.\[/caption\] One thing we've noticed is that fish in general is quite reasonably priced in the UK and tastes really good. We've been eating much more of it since arriving here.

Would we live in Edinburgh?
---------------------------

We were originally considering moving to Scotland, but ended up in London instead. We confess, Edinburgh is nice. Especially the people, who are really friendly. It's like we had forgotten what it is like to be surrounded by nice people, but Edinburgh, you helped to remind us. Thank you for that. The food and coffee culture in Edinburgh is also excellent from what we experienced. However, we're glad we decided to move to London in the end. Edinburgh reminds us strongly of Wellington, being a small, windy, hilly, easily walkable city. Apart from the architecture, it didn't really feel too different from home, so Edinburgh wouldn't have satisfied our desire to experience a different way of life. After spending a few days in Edinburgh we felt we'd seen a lot of what we wanted to see. There are still plenty of places we'd like to visit in Scotland - in particular we'd be keen to see the Highlands. But, in terms of keeping us entertained, nothing really compares to the thrills and excitement that London offers in abundance. That's not to say we don't want to go back to Edinburgh at some point. It might be good to explore when it's not raining or snowing! Jase and Kimmie
