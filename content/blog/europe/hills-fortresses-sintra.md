We went on a day trip up to Sintra, a beautiful forested municipality near Lisbon city. Sintra was the highlight of our trip to Lisbon, and we 100% recommend it! It's only a one hour train trip from Lisbon.

A lovely walk surrounded by wilderness
--------------------------------------

Sintra has a cute little town surrounded by woodland forest. It's rather picturesque. We picked up some bakery items on our way up the hill, including Sintra-famous queijadas. We found them fairly sugary, but a nice little pick me up! \[caption id="attachment_1542" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Kimmie tucking into a queijada.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/queijadas-sintra-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/queijadas-sintra.jpg) Kimmie tucking into a queijada.\[/caption\] The gentle walk up the hill was very peaceful, and we admired the art along the way. \[caption id="attachment_1546" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![In Sintra they work around nature.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-around-nature-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-around-nature.jpg) In Sintra they work around nature.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1543" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![A stylistic harp installation. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lisbon-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lisbon.jpg) A stylistic harp installation.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1544" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Art in front of a castle on the hill.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-art-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-art.jpg) Art in front of a castle on the hill.\[/caption\] We stumbled across some interesting gems on the way up, including this very cool fountain. \[caption id="attachment_1545" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Fonte Mourisca - a Moorish-influenced fountain built in 1922.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-bus-stop-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-bus-stop.jpg) Fonte Mourisca - a Moorish-influenced fountain built in 1922.\[/caption\]

Quinta da Regaleira
-------------------

Before our trip, we saw a vlog about this place and decided we had to go there! It's a large estate that's classified a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We had a great time exploring the tunnels, caves, spiral wells, gardens, and buildings. It was an adult playground! We had a ball, and could have spent half the day there. As it was, we were there several hours. I feel like the pictures speak for themselves, so instead of describing what we experienced, take a look for yourself! \[caption id="attachment_1569" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![The steep palace grounds.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-hill-1-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-hill-1.jpg) The steep palace grounds.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1570" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Looking out towards the Castle of the Moors.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-hill-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-hill.jpg) Looking out towards the Castle of the Moors.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1548" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![20th Century palace of Quinta da Regaleira.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sintra-palace-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sintra-palace.jpg) 20th Century palace of Quinta da Regaleira.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1564" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Intricate detailing inside the palace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/inside-the-palace-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/inside-the-palace.jpg) Intricate detailing inside the palace.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1565" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![3D wooden carving in the ceiling.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3D-wooden-carving-on-the-ceiling-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3D-wooden-carving-on-the-ceiling.jpg) 3D wooden carving in the ceiling.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1566" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Lion door knocker.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lion-door-knocker-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lion-door-knocker.jpg) Lion door knocker.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1567" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Painting on the wall of the palace.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/palace-wall-painting-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/palace-wall-painting.jpg) Painting on the wall of the palace.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1549" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Jase is the king of the fort thing.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-fort-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-fort.jpg) Jase is the king of the fort thing.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1550" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Dragon archway.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-dragons-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sintra-dragons.jpg) Dragon archway.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1556" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Iniciatic Well from the bottom.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well-from-below-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well-from-below.jpg) Iniciatic Well from the bottom.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1560" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Kimmie on the spiral staircase of the well.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well-kimmie-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well-kimmie.jpg) Kimmie on the spiral staircase of the well.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1551" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Jase at the top of the spiral Iniciatic Well.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jase-at-top-of-well-600x338.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jase-at-top-of-well.jpg) Jase at the top of the spiral Iniciatic Well.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1558" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Top-down view into a Iniciatic Well.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/well.jpg) Top-down view into a Iniciatic Well.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1552" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Jase in one of the tunnels.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jase-in-a-tunnel-338x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jase-in-a-tunnel.jpg) Jase in one of the tunnels.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1555" align="aligncenter" width="338"\][![Dare to cross the stepping stones?
