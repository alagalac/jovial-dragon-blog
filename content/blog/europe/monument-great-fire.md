Last weekend we walked up the Monument, which was built to commemorate the Great Fire of London. 

Background
----------

The Great Fire of London began in a baker's house in 1666 and destroyed a large part of the city, with only stone buildings surviving. Fortunately, few people perished in the fire. The Monument is located near to where the fire broke out. It has an internal spiral staircase which leads to a viewing platform. The platform is tiny (there is not even any room to sit down) but you get a great 360 degree view of London.

Looks are deceiving
-------------------

From a distance, the monument doesn't look very tall. There are so many tall buildings around London that, by comparison, it only looks about four or five stories high. \[caption id="attachment_304" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Monument in the sun.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/monument-sun-300x300.jpg) The Monument in the sun.\[/caption\] Tickets to go up the Monument were only £5, which is pretty cheap compared to what they charge to go up the Shard! When we went it wasn't overly busy either. The entrance is very small, and you're immediately confronted by the tall spiral staircase that goes up the middle of the column. After a few minutes of climbing stairs, we paused to see how much further to go. We were barely half-way up! \[caption id="attachment_306" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The tall spiral staircase.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/monument-stairs-300x300.jpg) The tall spiral staircase.\[/caption\] It was a relief when we finally reach the top. Judging by the height of nearby buildings, the tower is actually about 15 stories high!

The view from the top
---------------------

The Monument is taller than most of the buildings immediately surrounding it, so we had a nice panorama of the city. Unfortunately, we couldn't take any panoramic photos as there was mesh all over the viewing platform! Looking down, you couldn't help but feel that the people who built this tower were crazy. Making a column so skinny and so tall back in the 15th century must have been a huge feat of engineering. When it was first built, the Monument would have towered over every other building in the area. \[caption id="attachment_308" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the views from the top of the Monument.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/monument-view-300x169.jpg) One of the views from the top of the Monument.\[/caption\] Once we had taken in the view and made our way back down, we were surprised by a staff member who gave us a certificate of achievement for climbing up and down the Monument's 311 steps. What a climb! Our knees were glad to be back on flat ground! \[caption id="attachment_312" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with her certificate.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Kimmie-monument-300x169.jpg) Kimmie with her certificate.\[/caption\]   Jase and Kimmie
