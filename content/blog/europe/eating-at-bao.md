Kimmie ate at the famous [Bao](https://baolondon.com/) in Soho during her lunch break. Here are her thoughts. 

What is Bao?
------------

Bao is a well-known eating establishment in Soho, London. It specialises in Taiwanese dishes, and has received rave reviews (averaging 4.3/5 on Google, and being named by Timeout as one of the top 100 places to eat in London).

First impressions
-----------------

When I arrived at Bao at round 1pm it didn't look overly busy. I even spied some free seats. So I  opened the door to nab one. However, I was met by a server who pointed me towards the queue on the other side of the street. Oh. [![Bao in Soho.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bao.png-450x600.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bao.png.jpg) The line on the other side of the street didn't look too long, and I was determined to wait it out because I was already there. The wait ended up being about 15 minutes.

Bao's system for inviting guests in was not efficient or orderly. First, there was no signage telling people to wait across the street. Second, each time a seat became available the server had to walk across the road and invite people in. Third, they didn't have a system for parties of one (I thought maybe I could sneak in faster, like those 'single rider' lines at Disney). Fourth, there is no takeaway option, so you have to wait until you reach the front of the line.

Inside Bao
----------

The place is tiny. It can probably only seat about 30 people at a time. The atmosphere was buzzy, but felt a bit cramped.

Ordering
--------

I was given 2 sheets of paper to fill in for my food and drink order. Simple enough. I filled in the paper and handed it to one of the servers on their way past. I was also given a branded wet wipe to clean my hands. A nice touch.

It took quite some time before my two bao buns arrived. I was surprised that the couple next to me, who were seated 10 minutes after I arrived, received all their food before I did! When my bao came, they arrived separately, in tapas style.

Taste
-----

The bao were lovely and warm. They both tasted pretty good (I tried the classic pork and the lamb shoulder). Weird observation, but pork belly is served differently in the UK. It reminds me of pulled pork instead of the thick, very rich, strip of meat I'm used to back home. The bao were small, but also quite filling. Two were enough to fill me up!

Of the two I tried, I preferred the flavour of the lamb bao.

Overall
-------

Perhaps I have been spoiled by the high quality Asian food back home, as I felt the bao were no different to the ones served at places such as Mr Go's in Wellington. Don't get me wrong, the bao were nice, but they weren't extraordinary. I'm not sure they are worth waiting ages in line for. I also think the service could be friendlier and more efficient. If you do go, make sure you have plenty of time to spare. I wouldn't recommend trying to squeeze in a visit during your lunch hour as I did. I felt a bit anxious and rushed! Kimmie
