For Christmas Kimmie bough Jase tickets to go and watch an English Premier League football match between the Tottenham Hotspurs and Southampton.

Supporting the Spurs
--------------------

On Christmas day Jase received three presents from Kimmie. The first was some nice new touchscreen gloves. Jase's current gloves were fingerless, and so aren't warm enough in the snow! They had a logo of a cockerel on them. The second present was a big navy blue and white scarf with the same logo in a Tottenham Hotspur bag. Jase could already guess the third present! \[caption id="attachment_1370" align="aligncenter" width="338"\]![Jase with his presents.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wembley_tickets-338x600.jpg) Jase with his presents.\[/caption\] Jase was off on Boxing day with some friends to see the Spurs play against Southampton at Wembley Stadium.

Wembley Stadium
---------------

When you first arrive at the tube station near Wembley it's hard to miss the stadium. The stadium is huge and towers over everything. With a capacity of 90,000, it's the largest stadium in the UK, and the second largest in Europe. \[caption id="attachment_1369" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![No missing this stadium!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wembley_outside-600x338.jpg) No missing this stadium!\[/caption\] However, for such a large stadium, it's actually very well set up. Entering an exiting was quite quick, even though there was a lot of security. It was also quite efficient to get food and drink. There were no long lines. The stadium had very good crowd control too. Overall, it is a nice modern stadium, and much better than old Westpac Stadium in Wellington.

Watching the game
-----------------

Our seats were up quite high up, but it still felt like we got a really good view. The game was a fairly high scoring one, and we had a good vantage point to see the goals. Our team won 5-2. \[caption id="attachment_1368" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The view of the game.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wembley_view-600x338.jpg) The view of the game.\[/caption\] At the stadium you aren't allowed to drink alcohol within view of the pitch. At half-time we went for a drink around the concourse. Jase was a bit of a slow drinker, and so we didn't get back to our seats until after play had started. In the meantime, the Spurs  scored two goals! Our seats were directly above the away supporters. There was a huge contingent of security guards completely surrounding them. Since we were winning the away supporters looked a bit glum.

England's best player?
----------------------

During the game we saw Harry Kane (the striker for the Spurs) score a hat-trick. This saw him break the record for the highest Premier League scorer in a calendar year with 39 goals. This also made him the first player in Premier League history to score six hat-tricks in a year. In addition he was Europe's top goal scorer for 2017. A good player for sure!

Final thoughts
--------------

It was a fun day out with friends. Maybe Jase will go to more games in the future. :) Jase and Kimmie
