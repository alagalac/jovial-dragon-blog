Barcelona is very flat - perfect for walking and cycling. It is also blessed with beautiful weather, and that's not even whether the pros end!

Political uncertainty in Catalonia
----------------------------------

Merely days before our arrival in Barcelona there was a violent police response to an independence referendum. The news reported that 1,000 Catalan protesters were injured. There was also a giant strike. Things have since progressed, but we were lucky there was no violence while we were visiting. We did see lots of flags hanging off buildings and groups of people gathering. We also felt a general undercurrent of frustration in the air. \[caption id="attachment_1160" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Flags hanging off buildings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/catalan-flags-600x337.jpg) Flags hanging off buildings.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1165" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Peaceful protesters cross the road, and a pro-independence sticker.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flags-catalan-600x337.jpg) Peaceful protesters cross the road, and a pro-independence sticker.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1164" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A gathering of unionists.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/protest-600x337.jpg) A gathering of unionists.\[/caption\]

Shopping and food
-----------------

We didn't do too much shopping, but we enjoyed strolling around all of the little pop up markets everywhere. There was a lot of beautiful pottery and mosaic items for sale which we would have loved to buy!

### La Rambla

We strolled down La Rambla not because we really wanted to, mainly out of curiosity. We were of course conscious of the recent terror attack that happened there (and also of our belongings, as it's prime pick-pocket territory!). The pedestrian street was wide. There were some stalls down the middle and some interesting shops either side, including Desigual (Kimmie's Mum: we went in and had a look around for you!). Just off La Rambla the streets were rather abandoned. They looked tempting to wander down. \[caption id="attachment_1162" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Busy La Rambla.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/La-Rambla-600x338.jpg) Busy La Rambla.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1163" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A quiet side street off La Rambla.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/side-st-la-rambla-600x337.jpg) A quiet side street off La Rambla.\[/caption\]

### La Boqueria

There's an amazing food market just off La Rambla. It sells fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, and even sweet treats! We tried some local jamón and cheese. The meat was _very_ salty! We also had a nice fresh fruit smoothie, and Jase bought some exciting charcoal black salt! \[caption id="attachment_1167" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Chocolates for sale.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sweet-treats-market-600x338.jpg) Chocolates for sale.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1168" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![More interestingly shaped sweet treats!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/more-sweet-treats-600x337.jpg) More interestingly shaped sweet treats!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1169" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Meat, lots of meat...](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meat-barcelona-600x337.jpg) Meat, lots of meat...\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1170" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![...and fresh fish!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fish-barcelona-market-600x337.jpg) ...and fresh fish!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1171" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jamón and cheese.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meat-market-600x337.jpg) Jamón and cheese.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1172" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Fresh fruit smoothies and juices.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fruit-at-market-600x337.jpg) Fresh fruit smoothies and juices.\[/caption\]

### A flea market

A few times a week the free entry Mercat dels Encants is open. We went to have a look out of curiosity. Many old-fashioned bits and bobs were for sale. We even saw someone selling people's old photo albums, and others selling old gaming consoles. Needless to say, there was nothing we wanted to buy, but it was fascinating to wander around! \[caption id="attachment_1196" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A small section of Mercat dels Encants.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flea-market-bar-600x337.jpg) A small section of Mercat dels Encants.\[/caption\]

### Tapas!

You can't go to Barcelona without eating tapas. It's a fact. We enjoyed all the tapas we tried (including the all-you-can-eat Japanese sushi kind, but that probably doesn't count). It's great being able to try such a wide range of dishes. If you like a dish you can order it again, if you don't like one you don't have to eat much of it! \[caption id="attachment_1186" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Salad, croquettes, meat and cheese tapas.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tapas-1-600x338.jpg) Salad, croquettes, meat and cheese tapas.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1187" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Tapas - prawns and squid.

Parks
-----

The free area of Park Güell was lovely, large, and tranquil. We would definitely recommend that you take picnic with you and enjoy the natural surroundings. Onto the more urban parks. These parks provided a little bit of a retreat from traffic noise, but they weren't entirely quiet or calm - you always felt like the city wasn't far away. We saw lots of people walking their dogs (dogs are popular in Barcelona!). We, or rather Jase, tried his hand at a little rowing! Kimmie had a great time being rowed around, and Jase actually enjoyed the workout. \[caption id="attachment_1180" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The pro rower!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rowing-barcelona-600x338.jpg) The pro rower!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1181" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie enjoying the ride.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/enjoying-the-ride-600x337.jpg) Kimmie enjoying the ride.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1182" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Turtles. :)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/turtles-600x337.jpg) Turtles. :)\[/caption\] The parks had some interesting features, including a zoo and this giant fountain. \[caption id="attachment_1184" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A pretty fountain in Ciutadella Park.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fountain-barcelona-600x338.jpg) A pretty fountain in Ciutadella Park.\[/caption\]

Montjuïc
--------

We rode a cable car up Montjuïc, which is a short mountain of sorts. There was a short cable car to the top, but we are used to hills from back home so we decided to walk instead. At the top it was a bit strange. Like a ghost town! We walked past the stadium that hosted the 1992 Olympics, eventually arriving at the Botanical Gardens. Little did we know that the gardens had not yet established themselves - many of the rolling hills were barren. The gardens also seemed to specialise in trees instead of flowers.... At least it was cheap and we had the place almost entirely to ourselves? \[caption id="attachment_1191" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some of the trees at the botanic garden.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/trees-botanic-garden-600x338.jpg) Some of the trees at the botanic garden.\[/caption\] After the really quite strange wander around the abandoned gardens, we headed over to Montjuïc Castle. It was cheap to get into the castle, but that's probably good because again there was not much to do other than wander around. There was a small museum, but that didn't take much time to walk though. We learned some interesting things about the area's history, though. We thought it was strange that no one was selling food or drink nearby. It was a hot day and we were totally keen for an ice cream! \[caption id="attachment_1192" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Castle gardens in the moat.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/castle-bar-600x338.jpg) Castle gardens in the moat.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1194" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A gun at the castle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gun-castle-bar-600x338.jpg) A gun at the castle.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1193" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![View of the port from the castle.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/view-of-port-600x338.jpg) View of the port from the castle.\[/caption\]

The port and the beach
----------------------

It was nice to walk along the waterfront next to the beach (something you can't really do in London - the riverfront is more mud!). We saw huge fish swimming in the water too! The beach was very wide, and the sand was quite gritty and dusty. There were lots of people playing beach volleyball and other sports. The concrete walking promenade was wide and lined with palm trees. \[caption id="attachment_1174" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pretty port building.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/port-600x338.jpg) Pretty port building.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1175" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie posing with a pirate ship.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/port-barcelona-600x338.jpg) Kimmie posing with a pirate ship.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1176" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Wide orange beach.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/barcelona-beach-600x338.jpg) Wide orange beach.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1177" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Concrete promenade.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wide-concrete-prom-600x338.jpg) Concrete promenade.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_1178" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![People playing beach volleyball.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/beach-volleyball-600x337.jpg) People playing beach volleyball.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

Barcelona was a fun new place for us to discover. We loved how easy it was to walk everywhere, and the public transport system was easy to master too. The weather was the perfect temperature, so we'd recommend visiting Barcelona in October! We were in Barcelona for about four days. We thought this was enough time - you could even do all the best parts of Barcelona in less time. BUT, if you're a foodie then you'll need far longer than four days to taste all of the culinary delights - just make sure to eat when the locals do or else you'll find yourself outside closed restaurants!
