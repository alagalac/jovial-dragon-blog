Last Sunday we headed along to the [Shakespeare's Globe](http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/) theatre to watch a production of Romeo and Juliet.

The Globe theatre
-----------------

The theatre itself is actually a modern reproduction of the original. It is located about 200m away from the site of the original theatre which burnt down 400 years ago. Like the original, the reconstruction is built out of wood and has the same thatched roof. It's the only building in London that is allowed to have a thatched roof due to the potential fire hazard. Fortunately, the reconstruction has modern fire safety features like sprinklers! \[caption id="attachment_548" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Shakespeare's Globe theatre.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/romeo-globe-600x338.jpg) Shakespeare's Globe theatre.\[/caption\] The theatre itself is three stories high and arranged in a ring around the central stage. The middle of the theatre is not covered. Instead, it is left open to the elements.

Tickets
-------

The seats around the outside and on the second and third levels were wooden benches. You had to pay a few pounds extra if you wanted a cushion. The seats themselves were also quite pricey (from £25–£45). Instead we opted for the more plebeian 'yard' tickets. With the yard tickets you don't get a seat but instead stand in the middle of the theatre right up next to, and often amongst, the action. The stage is at about shoulder height. \[caption id="attachment_551" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Our view of the stage.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/romeo-stage-600x338.jpg) Our view of the stage.\[/caption\] Traditionally, the yard tickets were cheaper tickets to allow the general public to see the plays. The tickets were only £5, which is really cheap by London standards! The yard tickets are excellent value if you don't mind standing for the whole show and are okay with being open to the elements without a roof overhead.

The yard on a hot day
---------------------

The temperature on the day was absolutely sweltering. We were fortune to be standing in an area with shade, but others weren't so lucky. They had to pause the performance at one point when a person fainted. We were glad that we had food, and particularly water, with us. You can buy food and drink at the venue, and Kimmie ended up getting a Pimms cup. \[caption id="attachment_550" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with a well needed drink!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/romeo-drink-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with a well needed drink!\[/caption\]

The show itself
---------------

The show was almost three hours. We went to the matinee, but there are also evening performances. The performance provided a modern take of Romeo and Juliet. They used the dialogue from the original play, but modern props and interpretations. For instance they used guns and danced to the YMCA. At one point, they fired streamers into the audience. The actors were in a "day of the dead" theme, with their faces painted in white and their costume often being in either black or white. During the ball scene the actors were dressed in an eclectic array of costumes. Some were crazier that others – one actor was dressed as a dinosaur, another as Queen Elizabeth I, and others as strippers! We thought the acting was pretty good, especially considering the heat! You could see sweat pouring down most of their faces, and their makeup often had to be refreshed. During the performance, the actors made full use of the stage and the area in which we were standing. They wandered throughout the yard and sometimes interacted with the audience. At one stage a heavily made up actor kissed somebody in the audience! Also, a couple of times Romeo snuck up behind where we were standing and gave Kimmie a fright when he started belting out his lines. We weren't able to take any pictures of the performance due to the no cameras policy. Initially we were sad about this, but it would have been annoying if people were filming and taking pictures during the whole performance.

### Accessibility

We weren't aiming for a performance with captioning, but this performance was one of the only shows left with tickets available! We thought the captioning might be distracting, but they were actually really handy to read when we missed what an actor said or could not remember which character an actor was playing. We were also impressed by the range of people that the Globe caters for. There are sign language performances, midnight performances, and "relaxed performances" (specifically for children with an Autistic Spectrum Condition, individuals with sensory and communication disorders, and those with learning disabilities).

Overall thoughts
----------------

The performance of Romeo and Juliet was very non-traditional, but we thought this was a good thing. It made the performance more relatable, and it was nice to have a fresh take on what could otherwise have been quite a formal and abstract performance. We fully recommend that if you come to the Globe you try to get the cheap yard seats. Then you get the full immersive experience and the best view all for a bargain price! Your feet do get a little tired, but with the intermission it is not so bad, and you don't notice so much during the show as you're being entertained! We enjoyed ourselves so much that we bought yard tickets to see Twelfth Night at the Globe next month! \[caption id="attachment_556" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying a drink at The Swan after the performance. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/globe-post-performance-600x338.jpg) Jase enjoying a drink at The Swan after the performance.\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
