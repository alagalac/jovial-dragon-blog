On Friday we finally found a place to live in London! Thank goodness – it has been a painful and exhausting journey. We've been all over the place, looking at up to four flats a day (spread out across opposite sides of London!) and almost one every day since we arrived! Reflecting on our experience, we have learned some dos and don'ts of flat hunting in London, which we will focus on in this post. In Part 2, we'll talk a bit about flats we visited, including their surrounding area.

When flat hunting in London, do:
--------------------------------

*   **Have an idea of what you want:** what is important to you? If you had to list the five most important aspects of a flat, what would they be? Here are some things to consider when looking for potential flats in London (most are transferable to flat hunting everywhere!):
    *   **the safety of the area:** would you feel comfortable walking around the area by yourself at night?
    *   **how modern:** is an older and more rundown place a deal-breaker for you? Are you okay with mould?
    *   **flatmates:** what kind of people, and how many, are you happy to live with? Are you okay sharing a kitchen with five people who have a variety of work schedules and may decide to make mac n cheese at 3am?
    *   **space: **is having a living area important to you? Quite a few places here do not have lounges, as they have been converted into rooms!
    *   **dossing:** I didn't know what this meant, but it is a slang term for couch surfers. Are you okay having people crashing at your place all the time?
    *   **amenities:** do you need your own en-suite? Could you live without a tv or a dishwasher?
    *   **how quiet:** are you okay with a bit of noise? How about living right next to a main road or a nightclub?
    *   **how warm:** most places in London have double glazing, which is awesome. However, places differ a lot in terms of their winter heating bills. Better to be informed now then to be shocked later!
    *   **the landlord:** are they responsive and do they fix things when they break? Do they come around all the time or not at all?
    *   **the vibe:** what do you like to do on weekends? If you like to go for a swim then you might want to find a place nearby a pool. Is nightlife important to you, or do you want to live in a sleepy village?
    *   **location:** do you want to be near a supermarket? do you need to be close to public transport links, or do you have a car? How long a commute are you happy to accept? Do you want to go on overseas trips – and if so, how easy is it to get to an airport or to the [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com/uk-en)?
    *   **cost:** what is your budget? There's quite a price range in London. We found that a room in a good place, in an okay location, usually starts around £950 – £1200 per month inclusive of bills (in our case, the final amount is shared between two so it's not as bad!). Also, watch out for nasty fees, such as for reference checks.
    *   **timing:** how fast do you need a place? Do you need to make some compromises due to lack of time?
    *   **your situation:** when you're new to the country there's a lot counting against you. How do you prove you can pay the rent if you don't yet have a job? Have you sorted out how you will pay (by overseas bank account? [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/)?) Are reference checks required, and if so – you might want to check how likely you are to pass before paying the fee. How can you make yourself more appealing than your competition (because, there _is_ competition, and they are likely better practiced at flat hunting than you!!!).
*   **Research about the different areas of London:** this will help you to narrow your search. Being unfocused was one of our biggest mistakes!
*   **Prepare questions in advance:** we found it really handy to have a list of questions ready to ask at, or even before, each flat viewing.
*   **View the flat in person:** so many ads have pictures that are misleading, and when you see the place in person you're disappointed. It's also good to have an idea of the people you'll be living with if that's important to you.
*   **Get ready for disappointment:** we fell in love with several places, but this can lead to heartbreak if you get rejected. :(
*   **Accept that you may not get a response:** so many people do not reply to messages. We initially found this upsetting and rude, but it seems to be the way here. If you're not suitable then you may not get a response. The person is also likely to be fielding a lot of messages (we were, and we weren't even advertising a room!)
*   **Use existing networks and draw from their knowledge:** [Kiwis in London](https://www.facebook.com/LondonKiwis/) is awesome. Would recommend 100%. They also have an app for flat hunting.
*   **Create an ad:** we initially upgraded our [SpareRoom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk) account because we wanted to contact newly added "early bird" rooms. However, we found that having an ad was really helpful as people came to us! Yay! This made our search easier as people had already screened us and decided that we looked like people they could get on with.
*   **Be quick:** if you like a place, act quickly. It's the quick and the dead around here. Of course, being quick isn't everything as you have to still beat the competition, but at least you'll have a better chance.
*   **Treat it like an interview:** initially, we didn't really have our jam going. You should try to be well presented, smile lots, look keen, and make good conversation. Why should they choose you? Because you're awesome!
*   **Check up on the property managers:** if you find a place that is managed by a company, check to make sure they have good reviews. We did this just in time to avoid being fleeced by the Italian mafia (a story for another time!).

When flat hunting in London, don't:
-----------------------------------

*   **Work with agents:** feel free to if you want, but we preferred to avoid agents. They don't care about how well you might interact with your future flatmates, and they don't have much of an idea about the property they are showing you as they look after so many! Not to mention, you have to pay them fees for being an intermediary. Expect to pay up to £400!
*   **Look all over the place!** I cannot stress enough how stressful it is going from one suburb to another without any real knowledge of what the areas you're going to are like.
*   **Start looking too far in advance:** this one upset me a bit as I love to be organised. However, we found that it's hard to compete with people who are already in London, as they can view and take the room before you. Many advertised rooms also need people to move in ASAP.
