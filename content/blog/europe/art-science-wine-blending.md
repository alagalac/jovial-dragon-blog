Last Friday we tried our hand at the "fine art" of wine blending. We went with a group of friends that we met here in London.

The blending
------------

The one-off blending weekend was hosted by [Campo Viejo](http://www.campoviejo.com), a Spanish winemaker.  The venue was at a park in Waterloo. \[caption id="attachment_482" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The pop up venue.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wine-venue-600x338.jpg) The pop up venue.\[/caption\] When we arrived, we were directed to the bottom of a staircase and given lab coats to wear. This made us feel very scientific. The coats also served another purpose: protecting our clothes from red wine stains (the coats had warning stains from previous groups). Wine blending is a messy business! We sat down to an ornate table arrangement where we each had: 6 empty wine glasses, 3 bottles of red wine, 1 empty wine bottle, and some free **\*bonus\*** tapas! To blend, we chose percentages of each wine and added them together. We then sampled our mixture and took note of what we did and didn't like. Simple! Once we found the ultimate blend of our liking, we measured it into an empty bottle and labelled it. We named our final blends (which we got to keep) 'Cherry Red' and 'Red Tiger'. \[caption id="attachment_483" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A toast to our blending skills!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wine-toast-600x338.jpg) A toast to our blending skills!\[/caption\]

The verdict
-----------

While the lab coats and beakers made the process look and feel scientific, it was anything but. We only had three wines to blend from, and so after a while all of the different blends started to taste the same. On the plus side, we had great company and we also got a lot of wine! We drank while we blended, we were able to take glasses of wine with us, and of course we got to keep the wine that we blended! On top of all that, downstairs you could try one of their fancier wines for free if you participated in their Instagram promotion. \[caption id="attachment_484" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The final product.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wine-bottle-600x338.jpg) The final product.\[/caption\] Afterwards we all sat on the grass drinking red wine and prosecco. A great way to end the evening! We do have one problem: they bottled our take-home wine with corks, and we don't have a corkscrew! Jase and Kimmie
