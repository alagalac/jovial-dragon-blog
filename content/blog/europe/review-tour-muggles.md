Last Sunday we decided to step into the magical world of Harry Potter with a 2.5 hour walking [Tour for Muggles](https://www.tourformuggles.com/). Below are our thoughts.

At the beginning
----------------

> "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."

We arrived at the tour's meeting point and introduced ourselves to our guide. He was a very friendly, upbeat, and knowledgeable Ravenclaw. He also had a great sense of humour. After everyone had arrived, our guide asked which houses we were from. Most people (including us) declared themselves Hufflepuffs. There was one Slytherin, a few brave Gryffindors, and the odd Ravenclaw. Our guide said he would award house points during the tour for correct answers. \[caption id="attachment_279" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase with our Harry Potter tour guide.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HP-tour-guide-300x169.jpg) Jase with our Harry Potter tour guide.\[/caption\]

Seeing magic in the muggle world
--------------------------------

Our guide showed us some key filming and inspiration locations from the Harry Potter films. This included [Knockturn Alley](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Knockturn_Alley), [Diagon Alley](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Diagon_Alley), the [Millennium Bridge](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Bridge) destroyed by the death eaters, and the ship that inspired [the Durmstrang](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Durmstrang_Ship) (used by the Durmstrang Institute to reach Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament). \[caption id="attachment_290" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inspiration point for what a muggle would see if they looked at Hogwarts (ruins).](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Inspiration-point-Hogwarts-entry-300x169.jpg) Inspiration point for what a muggle would see if they looked at Hogwarts (ruins).\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_291" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Boat the inspired the Durmstrang.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HP-boat.-300x169.jpg) Boat the inspired the Durmstrang.\[/caption\] We enjoyed the fun facts our guide told us along the way. We were surprised at how many clever things J.K. Rowling weaved into her stories. Even down to picking a phone number that spells "magic". It was interesting to hear about how involved J.K. Rowling was in choosing the filming locations and picking the cast. She made sure the actors were British and that the filming locations accurately reflected how she imagined the places. We found it amusing how the purpose-built [knight bus](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Knight_Bus) was too tall to fit under a bridge and had to have its top chopped off and reassembled once past the bridge! Usually you can't film inside St Paul's Cathedral, but apparently they got permission to do so to film the [Divination Stairwell](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Divination_Stairwell). There's an interesting story behind this too, as apparently the building's architect wanted to add an observatory in the cathedral. This didn't eventuate in real life, but it did in the world of Harry Potter! In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix there is a scene in the Westminster tube station where Harry and Mr. Weasley take muggle transportation to get to the Ministry of Magic. Apparently the film crew hired out the tube station at a cost of £250,000 an hour! It was interesting to hear about the long hard road J.K. Rowling went down to get noticed and have her books published. It made us wonder about how publishing agencies assess and choose which books to publish.

The verdict
-----------

> "All was well."

Despite it being some time ago that we read the books and saw the films, we remembered many of the scenes our guide described (but were also thankful for the guide's picture visual aides!) and found we we able to answer many of the questions asked. The best thing about the tour was the guide, who entertained us the whole time. We also went through some interesting areas of London that we are keen to revisit. Overall, we would recommend this walking tour: 8.5/10. p.s. Hufflepuff won the most house points! Jase and Kimmie
