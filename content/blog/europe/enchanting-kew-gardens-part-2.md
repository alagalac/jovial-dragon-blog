Here's Part 2 of our Kew Gardens adventure! If you haven't already done so, check out [Part 1](http://coupleofkiwis.com/enchanting-kew-gardens-part-1/).

Fascinating flora and fauna
---------------------------

We enjoyed the wide array of flowers and other plants on display. There were so many we had never seen before; the variety was a feast for the eyes! We also noticed the wide range of settings, with some areas being quite natural and rough, and others very manicured. \[caption id="attachment_433" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Interesting pink flower.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-flower-600x337.jpg) Interesting pink flower.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_452" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A waterfall of flowers.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-waterfall-flowers-600x337.jpg) A waterfall of flowers.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_461" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A sea of flowers.

They were interesting to watch. The geese in the below picture were pretty protective of their young, so we didn't get too close! \[caption id="attachment_446" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Geese with their goslings.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-geese-600x337.jpg) Geese with their goslings.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_465" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An interesting type of duck (?) with her little ones. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-duck-600x337.jpg) An interesting type of duck (?) with her little ones.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_445" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]!["I'm a log" fish.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-fish-600x338.jpg) "I'm a log" fish.\[/caption\]

Architecture, statues, and fountains
------------------------------------

We enjoy stumbling upon buildings with detailed architecture, finding all manner of unique statues, and soaking up the relaxing rippling noises of beautiful elaborate fountains. Kew had many of these on offer for us to enjoy. \[caption id="attachment_457" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Unique glasshouses.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-architechture-600x337.jpg) Unique glasshouses.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_439" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Spiral water fountains.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-fountain-tall-600x338.jpg) Spiral water fountains.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_459" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A replica of the Medici Vase.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-greek-vase-338x600.jpg) A replica of the Medici Vase.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_463" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We love terminating vistas!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-term-vista-600x338.jpg) We love terminating vistas!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_449" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We randomly stumbled upon this bear. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-bear-600x338.jpg) We randomly stumbled upon this bear.\[/caption\]

Pretty walks
------------

Kew has a lot of interesting areas to stroll through. There's a woodland forest walk, a meandering bamboo grove, a passageway of different holly varieties, and even an international glasshouse and rock garden. Spoiled for choice! \[caption id="attachment_451" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase enjoying the relaxing woodland walk.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-woodland-600x338.jpg) Jase enjoying the relaxing woodland walk.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_442" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie amongst the bamboo grove.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-bamboo-kimmie-600x338.jpg) Kimmie amongst the bamboo grove.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_454" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Cacti in the international glasshouse. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-glasshouse-600x338.jpg) Cacti in the international glasshouse.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_455" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The terraced rock garden.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-terrace-rock-garden-600x338.jpg) The terraced rock garden.\[/caption\]

Other observations
------------------

Kew Gardens is really peaceful... but it would be more so if there was not a busy flight path overhead! Planes flew by every few minutes and they always looked quite low to the ground. \[caption id="attachment_430" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the many planes that flew past every few minutes.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-plane-600x337.jpg) One of the many planes that flew past every few minutes.\[/caption\] Kew has its own range of merchandise. We picked up some cider, honey meed, strawberry and champagne jam, and clementine chocolate! A nice way to end the day. We particularly recommend the meed and chocolateâ€“they were delicious! \[caption id="attachment_440" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kew has its own range of produce!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kew-purchases-600x338.jpg) Kew has its own range of produce!\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
