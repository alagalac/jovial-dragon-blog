Kimmie recently visited Armenia, a country not too many people get a chance to discover. Below she shares her observations and what she learned along the way.

A few facts about Armenia to get the ball rolling
-------------------------------------------------

Armenia is a very small landlocked country wedged between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Georgia, and Turkey. The population of Armenians in Armenia is currently around 3 million. However, a much larger world-wide diaspora numbers around 7 million.

In about the early 4th century AD, Armenia became the first state to adopt Christianity, and as a result, what may be the world's oldest cathedral (it's disputed), Etchmiadzin Cathedral, can be found there.

Iconic symbols of Armenia include the pomegranate, apricot, and Mount Ararat (an ever present sight in Yerevan, but it is actually located in present day Turkey).

Getting to Armenia
------------------

A lot of people do not know much about Armenia (including myself before this trip), and in my experience it is rare to meet someone who has traveled there. One of the inhibiting factors is the lack of direct flights; even indirect flights are expensive in comparison to indirect flights to Armenia's neighbours.

My flights from London, excluding transit waiting time, were between 6 and 6.5 hours long. This is not an insignificant journey, as on top of travelling between airports and the impact of different time-zones, it meant I essentially needed to set aside two full days to travel to and from Armenia.

To reach Armenia I had a choice between several—mostly ex-Soviet country's—airlines. This included: Polish Lot Airlines, Russian Aeroflot, Georgian Airways, Ukrainian Airlines, and then what appeared to be the odd one out: Air France. All London to Armenia flight options arrive and depart at horrible times in the morning (such as 2:00am or 3:00am). That is, except for Air France, which has far more civilized arrival and departure times. So, for the sake of my body clock, I went with them.

Travelling with Air France
--------------------------

I found the Air France planes a little old-school. Perhaps I have been spoiled by Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand, but the Air France planes did not have any entertainment systems. I couldn't even see where we were, as there was no flight tracker.

It's a good thing that, alongside my trusty book, I had some pre-downloaded Netflix shows to keep me company!

I couldn't really fault the food – it was decent.

_Top tip when travelling Air France_ \- everyone knows that you get more leg room in an exit row seat, and Airlines generally charge extra for the privilege of having that extra leg room. Interestingly, I found out that window exit row seats seats (A and F) are free. Definitely worth it if you want some extra leg room for free, the only catch is that one of the armrests is smaller as it is part of the side of the plane, instead of part of the seat.

Charles De Gaulle Airport
-------------------------

Unfortunately, I needed to transit through Charles De Gaulle Airport, which is a huge confusing nightmare. I was surprised to find out that even though I did not need to change terminals and was only transiting, I had to go through security again! This took over half an hour due to the long lines.

There are, however, a few good features about this airport, for example the amount of electronic power charging points (although, many were broken), comfortable chairs, as well as the entertainment options. I enjoyed playing the trial PS4 games on offer.

### Industrial action

I was extremely lucky, as many Air France flights were cancelled on days either side of my bookings due to industrial strike action. Phew! Something to keep in mind when booking Air France, as apparently strikes are not uncommon!

Zvartnots International Airport in Yerevan
------------------------------------------

Yerevan is the capital, and most populated city, of Armenia. Almost all international flights fly into Yerevan's Zvartnots International Airport. Compared to Charles De Gaulle Airport, this airport was easy to navigate! I had a fairly simple and smooth journey until I reached border security. That's because a few days before I arrived in Yerevan the visa rules had changed for Australians and New Zealanders. I thoroughly confused the border security guy when I handed over the e-visa I had been granted a few months earlier, since it was now no longer required. He went off to ask for help, and upon returning said "no need visa", then he stamped my passport and let me through. I would be more upset about the change if the visa had been expensive and a hassle to get, but luckily it was only US$5 and the online form was easy.

In my next post, I'll begin with the city of Yerevan. There will be more pictures!
