Our next stop on out Italian adventure was Bologna, the foodie capital of Italy. We weren't orginally going to vist Bologna, however out accommodation in Florence wasn’t available on two of the days, so we made a stop. We were glad we did.

The fat one
-----------

In Italy Bologna is known as “The fat one”, on account of all their delicious food. We didn’t eat a lot of food in Bologna, but we did have a delicious pizza. There is a lot of bad Americanised pizza in Italy, but this was good authentic pizza.

We stopped off at a cafe Aroma for come interesting coffees. We tried Caffe allo Zabaione, a coffee topped with a thick sweet Italian dessert.

The two towers
--------------

It seems like a lot of Italian towns and cities have towers. Bologna is no exception. However, like Pisa, they have a tower where they really didn’t build the foundations properly and so it is on an improbable lean.

We climbed to the top of the non-leaning tower, which was actually really high. The tower build back to 1109 and so was not really designed for tourism. There was only one narrow stairs up and down. The mean that they had to count how many people went up from the bottom, and then not let anybody else up until all of them came back down.

Up the top of the tower Jase could almost feel it swaying in the wind. That tower was definitely an earthquake risk!

Lunch in Modena
---------------

We caught the train over to Modena to check it out.

We had the best gelato we tasted in Italy in Modena.

With our morning coffee we tried Gnocco Fritto, a traditional Modenese fried bread made with lard. It was nice and salty with the coffee. We'd heard about it while watching a show on Netflix, but it took us a while to track down the cafe which sold it.

For lunch, we had a reservation at Franceschetta58, the sister restaurant to Osteria Francescana, reportedly the best restaurant in the world. We had a delicious lunch accompanied with a bottle of local wine.

Visit to the Acetaia
--------------------

Modena is of course famous as the home of balsamic vinegar of Modena. We manage to book a private tour around a local Acetaia, one of the producers of the traditional balsamic vinegar.

There we were greeted by a lovely Italian grandmother. She told us the story about how her mother was the first female master taster for the vinegar, and how her mother had to undergo years of training before she became an official taster.

She continues to produce the vinegar the traditional way in her attic. The barrels are stored in the attic as it gets very hot in summer, but cold in winter. Apparently, this helps the fermentation. The smell up there was amazing. Some of the barrels dated from the 1800s.

It is a very time consuming job creating the vinegar, as it has to be aged for a minimum of 12 years. The vinegar has to be moved into progressively smaller barrels every year as it ages. To retain the DOP classification everything must be measured and recorded. She even had to record the serial number of the bottle when we bought some!

In summary
----------

If you like food, then Modena and the surrounding area is well worth a visit. What we found particularly amazing was that every small town and almost every village had its own culinary tradition, and traditional cuisine. There were just so many delicious things to try!
