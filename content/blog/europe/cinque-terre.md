Our next destination was the five peaceful seaside villages of Cinque Terre.

Hiking and Wine
---------------

Cinque Terre is well known as a hiking destination. However we don’t know whether it quite deserves this reputation these days. The most famous Blue Trail between the villages is mostly permanently closed due to heavy rockfalls. If you want to hike the only section which still remains, it costs €7, which is a bit outrageous.

Instead we caught the train over to Levanto. From there we hiked a 2 hour train over the hill back to Monterosso. The supermarket was better in Levanto, and so we make sure to fill our bag up with Aperol Spritz (Jase’s new favourite cocktail) before leaving!

The hike was steep and hot. So we were very glad when we made it back to Monterosso. The views were worth it though.

Once back in Monterosso we thought that we had earned ourselves a nice wine tasting at one of the local vineyards.

Focaccia and Pasta
------------------

Focaccia bread is one of the local specialties around Cinque Terre. We took full advantage of this, and found a delicious focacceria where we had breakfast every day.

We did however start to run into the problem where it felt like all we were eating every day was focaccia bread and pasta. We started craving some vegetables!

One thing which we didn’t realise about our accommodation when booking is that they had an arrangement with a restaurant next door where the restaurant would bring food up to our own private terrace. This was amazing, and we took advantage of it every night!

Walk, Ferry, and Train
----------------------

On our last full day we were planning to visit the other villages which make up Cinque Terre. Unfortunately, the Italian train union picked this day to stage a train strike! In Italy the train strikes are fairly civilized, and so they only stop the trains between 9am and 5pm. To avoid this we got up early and caught the train down to Riomaggiore.

The villages mostly have one street leading towards the sea.

Supposedly Riomaggiore is very scenic, and it features on a lot of the photos of Cinque Terre. We didn’t really like it, as there wasn’t much there and we didn’t think it was very scenic. There is a famous path from Riomaggiore over to the next village Manarola called Via dell’ Amore (the path of lovers). Sadly we weren’t able to take this path as it is permanently closed due to landslips. Instead we had to hike up the hill and through a road tunnel, turning a 20 minute journey into an hour up and down the hill!

No lovers allowed.

We enjoyed Manarola much more as it was much more pretty and lively. After taking a look around and having some fresh orange juice we caught the ferry over to Vernazza (The ferry skips Corniglia as it has no port). The ferry cost 10 euro each, which was a bit outrageous for such a short trip!

Vernazza was somewhat cute, but very busy.

In Summary
----------

We enjoyed the peacefulness and tranquility of Cinque Terre, but we were also glad that we decided to stay in Monterosso. Monterosso just had much more to see, do, and eat than some of the other villages which were pretty tiny.
