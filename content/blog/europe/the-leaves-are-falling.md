It's autumn and the leaves are falling ominously. It's time for Halloween and its pumpkins. The mornings are becoming increasingly chilly, with the occasional fog.

The hauntings of Hampstead
--------------------------

To get into the Halloween mood we booked ourselves in to a ghost tour pub crawl. \[caption id="attachment_1205" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some pumpkins to get in the Halloween mood.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autumn_pumpkins-600x338.jpg) Some pumpkins to get in the Halloween mood.\[/caption\] The tour started in Hampstead, which is a very cute little village in north-west London. We're not sure whether it's just Hampstead, but there sure are a lot of ghosts and gruesome tales around the area. Over the course of the tour we visited four different pubs, each of which had at least a couple of ghosts. \[caption id="attachment_1206" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![One of the haunted pubs.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autumn_pub-600x338.jpg) One of the haunted pubs.\[/caption\] During the tour we walked across Hampstead Heath, a wild park, in the dark. Mid-way through we were held up by the highwayman Dick Turpin! \[caption id="attachment_1207" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Pumpkin spiced latte meets pumpkin spiced ale.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autumn_ale-600x338.jpg) Pumpkin spiced latte meets pumpkin spiced ale.\[/caption\] The tour had actors and actresses that popped out of nowhere at opportune moments during or after each ghost story. The most surprising thing to pop out of nowhere? A giant wooden wheeled chicken covered in Christmas lights! Talk about bizarre. Made for a good laugh though!

Epping Forest
-------------

The tube lines in London are actually surprisingly long, and travel quite a way out of London. On the weekend we decided to catch our regular Central line all the way out into the depths of Zone 6 to visit Epping Forest. \[caption id="attachment_1204" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Epping Forest in the autumn.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autumn_forest-600x338.jpg) Epping Forest in the autumn.\[/caption\] Epping Forest is a fairly large natural forest in north-east London. It's a nature reserve, although we didn't see many animals besides dogs and squirrels. \[caption id="attachment_1208" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie studying a plant.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autumn_kimmie-600x338.jpg) Kimmie studying a plant.\[/caption\] It was nice to get out of the city and feel like we were in the wilderness. However, we never really felt too far from civilization as in the far distance we could hear cars on the M25. That didn't stop us feeling like we could easily get lost though - the park is devoid of signs!

Onwards to winter
-----------------

The days are now much shorter and it's already getting dark at 4:30pm. The nights are getting frosty. Winter is coming! Jase and Kimmie
