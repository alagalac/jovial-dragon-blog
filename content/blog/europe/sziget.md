While we were in Budapest we spent three days at the Sziget festival.

About Sziget
------------

[Sziget](http://szigetfestival.com/) is one of the biggest music festivals in Europe, with almost half a million people visiting over the course of the festival. It runs over 7 days. \[caption id="attachment_822" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The main entrance to Sziget.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget-bridge-600x338.jpg) The main entrance to Sziget.\[/caption\] The word 'sziget' means 'island' in Hungarian. Fittingly, the Sziget festival is held on an island in the middle of Budapest. This makes it very convenient to get to. It also means that you can stay in a nice hotel in the city instead of camping in a tent! We took advantage of this.

The music
---------

The main draw card of Sziget is the music. While the lineup this year wasn't as good as previous years we still really enjoyed it. !["<yoastmark](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-chillaxed-600x338.jpg) \[caption id="attachment_823" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The Sziget main stage at night.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_mainstage-600x338.jpg) The Sziget main stage at night.\[/caption\] Some of the highlights were the Chainsmokers, Rudimental, Macklemore, and the Naked and Famous. Sadly Clean Bandit and Rita Ora cancelled at the last minute and were replaced by Iggy Azalea and Galantis. Iggy wasn't that amazing, but Galantis was good. Sziget had quite a few stages, which meant they catered to all musical tastes. Among the many stages were: a reggae stage, a world music stage, a Europe stage, a classical stage, and a techno stage. \[caption id="attachment_835" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inside the pumping techno tent.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_techno-600x338.jpg) Inside the pumping techno tent.\[/caption\]

The art
-------

One thing we really liked about Sziget was that it wasn't just about the music. There was a huge range of art too. \[caption id="attachment_831" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![We don't quite know what these things were.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_mouthart-600x338.jpg) Very strange representations of body parts.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_849" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Walking mechanical robot art.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-mech-600x337.jpg) Walking mechanical robot art.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_833" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Some funky sheep.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_sheep-600x338.jpg) Some funky sheep.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_844" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie with a big gorilla art installation.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-2-600x338.jpg) Kimmie with a big gorilla art installation.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_834" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A wolf sculpture.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_wolf-600x338.jpg) A wolf sculpture.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_838" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![There's an octopus in the tree!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_octopus-600x338.jpg) There's an octopus in the tree!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_850" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A Balloon Chain flying in the evening.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-chain-600x337.jpg) A Balloon Chain flying in the evening.\[/caption\] There's also a range of artistic activities to try, including painting, clay work, sewing, and woodwork. \[caption id="attachment_843" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lazer kiwi painting!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-600x338.jpg) Lazer kiwi painting!\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_845" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie painted a flag for the flag party.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bug-szi-3-600x338.jpg) Kimmie painted a flag for the flag party.\[/caption\]

The parties
-----------

Every afternoon there was a different party held at the main stage. On our first night it was the flag party. Some people brought their own flags, and we saw quite a few New Zealand flags. They handed out different coloured Sziget flags to people who didn't have their own flag. Everybody had to hide their flag until the countdown reached zero, after which time the music started pumping and everybody partied with their flags. \[caption id="attachment_825" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The flag party.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_flag-600x338.jpg) The flag party.\[/caption\] The next day was supposed to be the colour party where everyone throws coloured powder into the air. However, it was postponed due to the wind. Coming from Wellington it didn't feel very windy, but we were somewhat glad it was cancelled. We weren't keen to be eating coloured dust in the air. The final party we went to was a special Sziget birthday party to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the festival. They handed out birthday hats, streamers, and giant Lollipops. \[caption id="attachment_826" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Celebrating Sziget's birthday.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_birthday-600x338.jpg) Celebrating Sziget's birthday.\[/caption\]

Exploring the island
--------------------

The festival island is held is quite large and there were lots of nooks and crannies to explore. At one point, we came across a carnival. We played traditional carnival games, including one where we fished for wooden fish from a bathtub. We also watched a traditional French puppet show in a box. Before we left, we had fun going around on the miniature Ferris wheel. \[caption id="attachment_827" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The traditional French puppet show.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_puppet-600x338.jpg) The traditional French puppet show.\[/caption\] We came across a Hungarian folk village where we watched some traditional dancing and learned about their traditional clothes. \[caption id="attachment_848" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A lady talking about traditional Hungarian clothing.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-trad-clothes-600x337.jpg) A lady talking about traditional Hungarian clothing.\[/caption\] We ended one of our evenings by lounging about inside a giant inflatable sculpture. It was very peaceful. We could have slept in there if they didn't have a strictly enforced 15 minute time limit! \[caption id="attachment_837" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Relaxing inside the inflatable Luminarium structure.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_inflatable-600x338.jpg) Relaxing inside the inflatable Luminarium structure.\[/caption\] We enjoyed the Sport Zone, where there were lots of activities to try. Jase jumped off a tower onto a huge inflatable landing pad. \[caption id="attachment_828" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The tower that Jase jumped from.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_tower-600x338.jpg) The tower that Jase jumped from.\[/caption\] Also in the Sport Zone we watched people playing a competitive game of archery and what looked like football snooker. We played a quick game of foosball, which Jase won to Kimmie's dismay! We probably would have played more games if it weren't so hot! Late one night we went to the circus to watch the Cirque Alfonse: Barbu from Montreal. The performance was pretty good, although we felt that perhaps the best bit was the first act with the roller-skates. By 1am the circus was starting to drag on, and we just felt like going home to bed. We weren't expecting the free alcohol shots or the male nudity!

The passport
------------

Since the Sziget festival is so big and there's so much going on, it is easy to miss stuff. To encourage you to explore everything they give you a passport where you can collect stamps from different venues around the island, like a giant treasure hunt. Jase really wanted to collect all of the stamps, so on our last day we trekked around the island to find them all. The last stamp we needed was from XS Land, an area where you learn about how people with disabilities live. Unlike the other stamp booths, when we turned up to get this stamp they told us we had to work for our stamp and complete three challenges! Our first challenge was to navigate around a maze using a stick while blindfolded. Jase was very slow and was overtaken by Kimmie! \[caption id="attachment_829" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The blind maze.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_maze-600x338.jpg) The blind maze.\[/caption\] The second challenge was wheeling a wheelchair around an obstacle course. It was hard and Kimmie almost fell off the side of the course! \[caption id="attachment_830" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie in her wheelchair.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_wheelchair-600x338.jpg) Kimmie in her wheelchair.\[/caption\] The final challenge we completed was a short game of wheelchair basketball, which Kimmie's team won. After completing the passport with all of the stamps we returned back to the Sziget immigration control. Jase received a special Sziget tie as a prize! \[caption id="attachment_832" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Jase with his completed passport and tie next to a recycled bottle dragon.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_passport-600x338.jpg) Jase with his completed passport and tie next to a recycled bottle dragon.\[/caption\]

Final thoughts
--------------

We were glad to be staying in a hotel in the city rather than camping on the island. It meant that we always had a nice hot shower, clean bathroom, quiet room, and comfy bed waiting for us. We took advantage of that shower and ended up having two showers a day! !["One](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/sziget_camping-600x338.jpg) During then festival the dust was really bad. You could see it and smell it while walking around. When we arrived back at the hotel we noticed that our nose mucus was black. Gross! We ended up getting a little sick after the festival. Being around lots of people might be to blame, but we reckon that the dust was the main culprit! Sziget was a fun experience and we're glad we went. Many thanks to our friend Gigi who kindly glittered us up ready for the evenings! \[caption id="attachment_853" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Glittered up and ready to go!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bud-szi-glitt2-600x337.jpg) Glittered up and ready to go!\[/caption\] Jase and Kimmie
