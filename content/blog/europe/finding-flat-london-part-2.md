London's a bit overwhelming, and it's very diverse. Where do you even start to look for a place? What areas are good? No one really gave us hints, and the internet didn't really help either. The main advice we got was to look north or west. In [Part 1](http://coupleofkiwis.com/finding-flat-london-part-1/) we talked about some dos and don’ts of flat hunting in London. In this post we talk about our impressions of the places that we viewed while flat hunting.

Here's a map of all of the places where we looked at flats. As you can see, we explored quite a few different neighbourhoods! \[caption id="attachment_331" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The locations of all of the flats in London that we visited.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/flat-viewing-map-300x166.png) The locations of all of the flats in London that we visited.\[/caption\]

Breakdown by neighbourhood
--------------------------

### Little Venice

Little Vince is a nice, peaceful area. It has adorable canals with houseboats. It is also very close to the well-connected Paddington Station, which is very handy! We were a bit sad when we missed out on a place here (Kimmie felt so organised having this viewing booked in for the day after our arrival in London!). The place was modern and we liked the two very talkative flatmates. Because we liked the vibe of the area so much, we went to see another place in Little Venice. However, it was nowhere near as good as the first place. Coupled with our disappointment of missing out on the first place, a sad stigma of rejection lingered over Little Venice for us. So, we decided to look into other areas of London. \[caption id="attachment_319" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A canal in Little Venice.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Little-Venice-300x169.jpg) A canal in Little Venice.\[/caption\]

### Dalston/Newington Green

This area has some nicer parts and some more run-down parts. We looked at a place that was between the two worlds. However, both worlds had quite a lot of rubbish littered around on the streets which wasn't very attractive. The place we viewed was tall and skinny. It had quite a few stairs. The flatmates were a Kiwi/British couple who were pretty chatty. We thought we might be able to get along with them, so we registered our interest in this place only to again miss out. If we had gotten this place, one awkward thing we would have needed was a bed. Apparently the bed was not included! \[caption id="attachment_270" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Dalston/Newington Green area style of housing.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Neighbourhood-flat-hunting-300x187.jpg) Dalston/Newington Green area style of housing.\[/caption\]

### Hampstead Village

Hampstead is a sought after, affluent area. The village itself had a sleepy feel about it. We thought it was very quiet and kind of cute. [Hampstead Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampstead_Heath) is also nearby, which is a nice place to stroll around during the day. While the area was nice, we decided not to register our interest with this one. Kimmie felt that it was a bit isolated (you can only really get there from the Northern tube line) and that it was overly sleepy for our purposes. We also weren't a fan of the state of the shared bathroom or the broken dishwasher (we were told that the landlord is not very responsive about fixing things).

### Swiss Cottage

This area is full of families. That's not a bad thing, as it felt safe. Then again, it didn't really feel like the neighbourhood for us. When we viewed the property it was a definite no. The whole place was dirty. The kitchen was gross, the fridge looked like it hadn't been cleaned in five years, and it had no natural light. Somehow, a little dining room table had been crammed into the kitchen (so there was no room to actually use the kitchen). The place was cold and dark and depressing. We never met the flatmates, but that's because we were shown this one by an agent. He didn't seem overly fussed about anything and tried to convince us about how much of a great deal the place was. On a random note, Kimmie noticed that the agent had glitter all over him...

### West Hampstead/Kilburn

This area is also excellently located, with several transport options including the Thameslink, which we previously hadn't thought much about. The Thameslink goes straight to Luton airport, which is very convenient for weekend getaways! We loved the flat that we viewed. It was really homey. The flatmates were a kiwi couple and were really lovely. We were super keen to get this place, and while one of the flatmates said we had made a good impression, we again missed out to another couple. :(

### Maida Vale

This area seemed fine, but not as pretty as the likes of Little Venice or Hampstead Village. We did however like how it straddled two different tube lines. In the place we viewed, one of the bathrooms was out of order and had been converted into a broom closet! Other than that, the house was perfectly fine. We also got along with the flatmates and their cat. What put us off this one was a comment that was made as we were exiting. One of the flatmates told us that there was an extra person living upstairs who was not technically allowed to live there. The flatmate said not to mention this to the landlord. \*red flag alert\*

### Shoreditch

Shoreditch is a bit alternative and it's known for being trendy. Kimmie viewed this place during the day by herself while Jase was toiling away at work. During the day she felt fine walking around alone, but she felt it would be a bit unsafe at night. There were quite a few shady people lingering around. The place she viewed was very messy. She was told by the flatmate that it was not normally that bad, but she found this hard to believe as it looked like a mess that had accumulated over time. The place had a dossing calendar, which didn't impress Kimmie at all. She was also told that the neighbours often throw really loud parties and that every now and then smashed glass can be heard from outside. There was also a pub right around the corner. Needless to say, it was not quite what we were looking for. \[caption id="attachment_325" align="aligncenter" width="300"\]![There was quite a lot of graffiti in Shoreditch.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shoreditch.jpg) There was quite a lot of graffiti in Shoreditch.\[/caption\]

### Hammersmith/Shepherd's Bush

This area is nice, albeit a little bit further from central London. Kimmie saw these places by herself during the day. She liked the tree lined streets and the quiet atmosphere. She also loved the nearby shops and the _GIANT_ Westfield!! After wandering around these areas (which are close to each other) it was obvious that it was our kind of place, and we could quite easily live there. Funny enough, Kimmie initially tried to avoid this area as she knew it was overrun by Kiwis and Aussies. However, the area won her over and now she understands why it's so popular with antipodeans! \[caption id="attachment_335" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The giant Westfield which is 6th largest shopping centre in the UK. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Westfield-Shepherds-Bush-300x78.jpg) The giant Westfield which is 6th largest shopping centre in the UK.\[/caption\] One place she viewed was really nice and modern. However, she never got to meet the flatmates. We actually made an appointment to sign the papers for this one, but then Jase saw the letting agent's reviews online which said to avoid the Italian-mafia-style-company like the plague. So, we cancelled our meeting 30 minutes before we were due to arrive! Jase sent them a sassy message saying that we weren't coming due to their poor online reviews. They didn't respond! Kimmie also liked the other place she viewed in this area. We actually ended up being offered this place, but we had unfortunately already paid the holding fee for the place we eventually got in East Acton. :( On the bright side, at least we missed out on all the outrageous agency fees associated with this one. It's normal here to pay around £400 just to rent a flat, with similar fees applied when you leave!

### East India

We weren't looking at places in East London. However, a British guy contacted us asking if we'd like to visit his place in East India. We decided to check it out just in case. To get there, we had to take the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which is a light rail similar to a monorail. The ride was quite pleasant. Sometimes it felt like we were cruising along in the sky. The place we viewed was very new. We would have been keen to rent it if the area was not so boring. There was nothing to do or see there. It was devoid of any kind of personality, and we would have had to use public transport to get anywhere exciting (or even to a simple coffee shop!).

### Highbury and Islington

This area had a nice charm about it. It's also well located, being close to the huge and very well connected King's Cross St. Pancras Underground Station. It's also not far from Camden town, which has some nice little cafes with decent coffee. Again, we showed our interest in a place here but did not get it (so much rejection is a bit depressing, no?).

### North Kensington

This is quite a posh area! There were little kids getting private tennis lessons and playing cricket in their tiny white uniforms. There were lots of quiet streets with upmarket houses and perfectly manicured lawns. The lovely Notting Hill is a walkable distance away. In the flatshare that Kimmie viewed, we would have had quite a few flatmates. This was not too much of an issue as we would have had an ensuite, but we didn't like the idea of having a set slot whereby we were able to cook dinner. Other quirks of the place were a gross sleeping bag outside that had been there for ages, a fridge that was only accessible by wading through stored junk, and an ironing board with lots of burn marks all over it. A case of nice area but not so nice flat...

### East Acton

How in the world did we end up here? East Acton was certainly not on our search radar. It's on the central tube line. Which is actually quite convenient as you can easily get on any other tube line from the central line. The line itself is renowned for being one of the busiest, making it uncomfortably warm and crowded at peak times. Kimmie randomly stumbled upon our new place on Spareroom (usually she ignored the ads at the top). The agent guy contacted her soon after she made the enquiry and she managed to view the place on the same day. Our place is a small studio apartment—definitely not our dream place—but it is sufficient for our current needs. We mainly needed a place to live that wouldn't bond us for ages (we didn't want to sign a 12 month contract). The other great thing about our place is that it is owned by a private landlord. This meant that we avoided any letting fees, including for reference checks. Bonus!

#### What is East Acton like?

There's a small village in the middle of East Acton. It has a bizarre range of shops including four Polish supermarkets, a halal kebab store, a Chinese and Thai takeaway, at least five fried chicken shops, a pharmacy, and the most depressing supermarket we have ever visited: Iceland. The houses range in style. There are nice brick ones. Then there are multi-coloured/multi-textured houses, which are usually made up of one house that has been divided into several homes. It's so weird to see the sudden change in styles, with one half of a house in one colour and the other half in another. This colour change even occurs on the archways that part the homes! \[caption id="attachment_342" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A curved house in East Acton.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/east-acton-300x169.jpg) A curved house in East Acton.\[/caption\] Nearby, there is Wormwood Scrubs Park. This is a huge green space. It has some sports facilities and a nesting ground for rare birds. It also has a few playgrounds, including an outdoor gym! \[caption id="attachment_343" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie on the outdoor gym equipment.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kimmie-gym-300x169.jpg) Kimmie on the outdoor gym equipment.\[/caption\] At least our flat search is over. For the next six months, anyway! Jase and Kimmie
