A few months ago, Kimmie applied for her visa (Jase doesn’t need one as he has a British passport). This two-part series is all about her experience. [Part one](http://coupleofkiwis.com/youth-mobility-scheme-visa-process-part-1/) was about her pre-application research and the application form. Part two covers the biometric appointment, sending off the documents, and her final comments.

The biometric appointment
-------------------------

The online application form asked where I would like to have my biometrics appointment. I chose the closest location, which happened to be at Immigration New Zealand. My confirmation email told me that I wasn’t allowed to be late, and that if I was late I would need to re-book. So, on the day, I made sure to arrive early! Upon arrival, I was confused. My email directed me to level 2 of the building. However, I did not have to go up any levels! Perhaps level 2 needs to be renamed to ground level. I had chosen the first available time-slot of the day, but there were already many people waiting in line. When the doors opened, everyone filed in. I got the security attendant’s attention and asked whether I was meant to wait in the line as I had a specific appointment time. He had no idea, but he checked with someone and then the next thing I heard was a grumpy sounding lady instructing people with biometric appointments to go and sit in the corner. I sat in the corner next to a chatty lady who told me all about why she was there. About five minutes past the time of my appointment a door suddenly swung open and I was ushered inside. The man said very little. He scanned my passport and tapped some things into the computer. He took my photo. He then tried to take my fingerprints, but the machine did not cooperate. I retried the fingerprint scanner several times. It was a bit awkward. The guy even told me off for putting my thumbs too close together! At the time, I thought: _sorry if I’m not experienced at giving my fingerprints to authorities!_ After our quick meeting (it took less than ten minutes), he handed me a piece of paper with instructions. I hadn’t realised there was _another_ step in the process!

Sending off my documents
------------------------

I decided I would send my visa documentation in the mail on the same day as my biometric appointment, as I really wanted to finish the process. Unfortunately, this meant quickly coming to terms with the poorly written piece of paper I had been given (suggestion to the UK immigration authorities: re-write and reformat both your online form and the next steps instruction document!) One of the listed requirements was a printed UK passport photo. I’d heard of this requirement, but had I hoped it was no longer necessary (the biometrics guy also just took my photo…?!). Printed passport photos are so expensive, and I resent being forced to pay for a whole set. Who needs 6+ UK sized passport photos? Especially when they are _unflattering_. ☹ To my dismay, they also required a scanned copy of my passport (again, I’m not sure why, as the biometrics guy just took a scan of my passport!). I didn’t want to have to find somewhere to scan my passport, so I asked the lady at the post shop if she could help me. She was a bit miffed, and told me she was not a photocopying service. I was obviously aware that she was not a photocopying service, but I _had_ just spent about $40 to post some documents. I was relieved when she reluctantly agreed, but I left with a negative impression of the post office’s customer service! \[caption id="attachment_124" align="alignnone" width="300"\]![All of the contents that I needed to send away.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/items-at-post-office-300x230.jpg) All of the contents that I needed to send away.\[/caption\] Before I sealed the post bags (I had to buy two, due to the convoluted process where it is sent to Auckland and then forwarded to the processing hub in Manila) I checked everything multiple times. It was a huge relief to finally send everything off. What an ordeal.

Final comments
--------------

### **Overall timeline**

Application started:

23 January 2017

\[Several day interlude of confused and circular research. I also needed time to track down the required information and supporting documents\]

Online application completed:

29 January 2017

Visa Application Centre appointment:

10 February 2017 \[earlier appointment dates were available\]

Visa documents sent off:

10 February 2017

Vignette visa received*:

28 February 2017 (the vignette visa is valid for 30 days from my stated date of entry into the UK. To finish this process, I need to collect the Biometric Residence Permit within 10 days of arrival.)

***note**: I was told I would receive a confirmation email when my passport and other documents were being returned from the processing hub in Manila. I never received one! Luckily, I knew it was a bit of a lucky dip – some people get confirmation emails and some don’t. When I received my vignette in the mail it was accompanied by an important letter. However, it got crushed in the mail! It will be a bit embarrassing presenting this at my designated London post office! \[caption id="attachment_125" align="alignnone" width="225"\]![My very crumpled successful visa application letter.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/crumpled-paper-225x300.jpg) My very crumpled successful visa application letter.\[/caption\] As you’ve probably gathered, I found the visa process irritating and exhausting. However, I think this made me appreciate the arrival of the vignette even more than I would have if the process had been easy! Not to mention, I needed my passport for another short overseas trip that we had booked before our UK one. Phew! Onwards and upwards! Kimmie
