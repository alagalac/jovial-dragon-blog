We spent our day doing errands and enjoying the sunshine. ¬†Oh, and dealing with an unexpected surprise!

What we did on our last full day
--------------------------------

After grabbing a coffee with some friends and buying some last-minute things, we spent several hours packing. Luckily, we started packing last weekend so we weren‚Äôt starting from scratch. Good thing too, as packing for the UK has been a stressful experience. The contents of our bags are a lot different to what we would usually pack for a holiday. For example, we are bringing games, Jase has got his coffee V60, and would you believe it ‚Äì Jase managed to fit his entire yoga mat in his bag! \[caption id="attachment_89" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Packed bags. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170430_152757-1024x576.jpg) The difference between girl packing and boy packing...\[/caption\] We have some pounds we are taking with us (thank you shout out to my brother for this present!). Comparing our currencies, I think that New Zealand is¬†far more beautiful! \[caption id="attachment_91" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A five and fifty pound note.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170506_135640-1024x948.jpg) A five and fifty pound note.\[/caption\] Today was such a beautiful day. It would have been a crime to stay inside all day! So we went outside and enjoyed the sunshine and nearby wildlife. üòä \[caption id="attachment_94" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Sheep enjoying the grass. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170506_134024-300x169.jpg) Sheep enjoying the grass.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_93" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Chickens eating out of hand. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170506_133915-300x169.jpg) A few of our domestic chicken friends.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_95" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Freddie the cat relaxing in the bushes. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/freddie-in-bush-300x189.jpg) Freddie the cat relaxing in the bushes.\[/caption\] We also went for a walk. It was lovely walking through native bush and¬†listening to tuis and other wildlife singing along the way. The views weren‚Äôt too bad either! \[caption id="attachment_97" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie soaking up the view of KƒÅpiti island. ](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Optimized-IMG_20170506_160530-300x183.jpg) Kimmie soaking up the view of KƒÅpiti island.\[/caption\] At the end of the day Kimmie got some mail. A jury summons! Interesting timing to say the least! Unfortunately she's unavailable to attend the High Court on 29 May! We emailed the Ministry of Justice our plane tickets, which will hopefully get Kimmie off the hook. \[caption id="attachment_98" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Documents summoning Kimmie to serve on a jury!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Optimized-IMG_20170506_133528-300x169.jpg) Documents summoning Kimmie to serve on a jury!\[/caption\] We rounded off the day at [The Salt and Wood Collective](https://www.facebook.com/Salt-and-Wood-Collective-1497005067294857/) with good food with good company. We‚Äôre looking forward to one last coffee catch up tomorrow, and then it‚Äôs off to the airport to start our long journey to the UK! We‚Äôre going on Singapore Airlines, and if you were one of the people who told Kimmie to try the Singapore Slings, we might just take you up on that advice! Jase and Kimmie
