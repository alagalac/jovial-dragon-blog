Hello everyone. We spent today exploring Chiang Mai on foot. We walked around the old town square and a trendy neighbourhood called Nimmana. All in all over 8kms of wandering. We quite enjoy exploring new places. :-) _Advanced warning_: today's blog is more food-focused than usual. **Our mellow morning** This morning I noticed a lantern on the roof of our hotel (see below). They are scattered all over the place in the wake of yi peng (the festival's last night is tonight).

Opposite our hotel is this lovely boutique coffee shop. It reminded me of _Omotesando Koffee_ in Japan, and it can only seat about 4 people. We also enjoyed some fresh croissants for breakfast.

Very cute.

Jase reckoned that it would make a good tourist attraction of they fixed it up a bit and put on tours. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-271163182jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-271163182jpg.jpg) We noticed interesting contrasts between old and new style buildings. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-714155334jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-714155334jpg.jpg) Jase wanted to be manly. Turned out his _Man Some_ drink was just apple juice. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-791346452jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-791346452jpg.jpg) We stumbled on cool bridges and old remains of the fortress walls. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-725639217jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-725639217jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-733957966jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-733957966jpg.jpg) **Navigating around Nimmana** On our way to Nimmana we saw this old and somewhat in-need-of-a-makeover mall (as well as a SQUIRREL!  :) ). We discovered that their toilets didn't have toilet paper...good thing I'd read about such places online and had tissues available! [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1004838042jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1004838042jpg.jpg) Nimmana is very cool. Quite trendy. Lots of interesting cafés and restaurants to check out. If only we had more time... We stopped at this cutesy healthy juice bar called _Sweet Rabbit_. They even provided props to play with.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1714338408jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1714338408jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-12548570jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-12548570jpg.jpg) After lunch we bumped into this cool shop called [Elephant Parade](http://www.elephantparade.com). It raises money to help elephant conservation. We thought all their elephant ornaments designs were cool and didn't mind helping the cause. We bought a neat Christmas decoration. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1588824019jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1588824019jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1725835233jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1725835233jpg.jpg) You may have noticed we're quite into our coffee, so we couldn't pass by [Ristr8to](http://www.ristr8to-coffee-chiangmai.com) without trying something. It reminded me a bit of _Hangar_ in Wellington. It was funny seeing a flat white on the menu. They had attributed it to Auckland too (say what?? Wellington is where the NZ coffee scene is at!!). I tried their Godmother Mocha (served in a plastic skull cup...!?) and Jase tried their signature Cigar8to. We liked the coffee (mine was so nice and silky) but thought the service and atmosphere could be improved. It felt like they were herding people in and out as fast as they could due to the place's popularity. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-228406112jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-228406112jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1372068754jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1372068754jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2007479058jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2007479058jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1495481524jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1495481524jpg.jpg) Jase said to me this afternoon that every day here should have siesta hour because it's so hot. I suggested that instead each day should have a massage hour. From about $8NZD an hour, why not?? Speaking of massages we got a foot massage and herbal compress (which was definitely quite hot if it was left it one place too long!!!) in the afternoon. We decided to try out [Lila Thai Massage ](http://www.chiangmaithaimassage.com/home.php)which has ex-inmate masseuses. It's actually quite a cool programme that aims to cut down on crime by giving the women a secure job and income, free from discrimination. **A delightful dinner** We ate at this very cute little French place for dinner. The waiters were very attentive and the food quality was very high. They also provided cute bread buns in mini pots (served with a radish on ice which we were perplexed about. Thank goodness for Google) at the start of our meal, and a palate cleanser at the end of our meal. I can only imagine how much this kind of meal would cost back home (a lot!). [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-390350887jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-390350887jpg.jpg) It was pretty walking home watching the lantern-filled sky (albeit stressful because walking and observing is hard in Thailand, you might fall into a hole in the ground or trip up). There were also candles all over the place and the temples/wats were lit up. Early start tomorrow for another exciting adventure! -Kimmie
