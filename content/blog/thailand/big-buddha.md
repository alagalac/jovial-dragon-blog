Today we went to the place where Buddha gave his first lectures. We had a fairly long tuktuk ride and then we met a local guide at the Chinese Buddhism shrine. From there he showed us around the main shrine where we saw the Buddha tree and the golden Buddha. We then went next door to the stump I think it was called. This is a giant concrete mound which was created to commemorate the location. For lunch we went to a local Indian restaurant. The food was dirt cheap. For 65 rupees I had a really nice vegetable chowmein. It was a bit awkward with a few of the girls trying to order cheese sauce and Nutella pancakes. They aren't likely to serve that in the middle of nowhere in India. Later it was back to the hotel. We went out to a restaurant which served steak for dinner. Nobody dared order it though. The food was overpriced and not very good. The next day we took a long rickshaw ride to see the monkey temple. There were lots of monkeys playing about. They were really cheeky, and kept trying to pull the saris off passing women. We navigated our way through the streets and alleyways (thanks Google maps) to get to the Ganges where we walked along the ghats. It was really hot and peaceful. We spotted a nice looking rooftop and went up there for lunch. It was actually the top of a nice looking hotel, and the food and service were really good. I had some delicious samosas, and the sweet Indian balls for dessert. It was a fairly expensive meal, but we figured it was worth it for the amazing view and the quality food. Back at the hotel we went next door for Freezo ice cream. Javier and Tara put me on to them, and they're really good. You get a cute ceramic pot filled with saffron flavoured ice cream topped with pistachio nuts. Delicious. They'd sell like hot cakes back home. I bought some and then we went up to the rooftop lawn of the hotel to read and enjoy the ice cream in the sun. A few monkeys jumped over from a near by building, and the hotel staff tried to chase the off. No dinner. Instead we hopped on our final sleeper train. I don't think I've mentioned before now, bit all of the railway stations in India stink. It's because the trains all dump raw sewerage onto the tracks. The pillows and sheets were extra on this train, so I ended up using my half empty bottle of water wrapped in a shirt as a pillow. The train wasn't too uncomfortable, except for the people yelling "Chai, chai, chai" at six in the morning when we were still trying to sleep. In the afternoon we wen in a street kid walk through the alleyways to see how the street kids live. Most of then have run away from home due to abuse. They spend thee time living on the street begging. The earn about 200 rupees a day which they spend on food, movies, and glue to sniff. We visited a school which was set up to help the children. There we went inside and did a dance class with them. They were all pretty eager to play.
