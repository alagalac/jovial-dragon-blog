Kia ora. A few days ago we booked a day trip to Doi Inathon National Park through our hotel. They had a clear-folder containing tours and trips that they said they could discount. The trip operator was not often named. Usually, we book activities online following extensive research, but this time we decided to try our luck and hope for the best. We were picked up around 8.30am. I noticed that our names were the only ones on his sheet. Turned out we were the only ones booked for today! This was both cool and somewhat concerning. The trip was about an hour. Our driver didn't talk much.

Strange since we'd just been in a van for an hour!

He spoke English but was still hard to understand. His commentary was limited to short explanations like "wild banana", "ant home", "termites", "coffee bean plant". At least we mostly got the gist. We walked through a variety of terrains, walked up and down hills, through bush, over dodgy looking makeshift bridges, and over rivers and creeks. We saw a variety of different plants and animals (including so many different kinds of butterflies and ants!!). My favourite plant was similar to a venus fly trap. When you touched the spine of the plant it closed up.

It was a cool waterfall that you could walk behind. We had to navigate across a weird plank bridge to get to it. Our guide prepared a nice lunch for us, and we also tried out some local organic coffee. All of the villagers' dogs kept a close eye on us in case we wanted to share.

Our guide also fed some eels in there. After lunch we walked for about an hour and then our guide asks if we want to go the long or short way. The long way you got to see a local village. We didn't really know what we were getting ourselves in for, but we chose the long version. We soon found out this meant quite a bit of an uphill climb. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2008330895jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2008330895jpg.jpg)Saw some nearby elephants... [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-82984276jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-82984276jpg.jpg) When we got to the village we got to see how the locals lived. There were lots of farm animals around such as chickens and pigs. There also, sadly, was a monkey chained to a tree. The monkey looked like it had a big goiter on its neck. :( [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1755789017jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1755789017jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-643802766jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-643802766jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-409959627jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-409959627jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-490969510jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-490969510jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1394394449jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1394394449jpg.jpg) It was interesting to see the village school, and we also walked past a volunteer home stay project. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1593413531jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1593413531jpg.jpg) Papayas were all over the place. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-177908938jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-177908938jpg.jpg) Our guide showed us how the hut roofs are made of tree leaves. He later showed us the tree the leaves are from. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-522218748jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-522218748jpg.jpg) We walked through some more bush and a lot of bamboo. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1641412996jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1641412996jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1217877060jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1217877060jpg.jpg) We then clambered down some rice paddy terraces, passing some resident cows. Oh, and some traffic (a motorbike). [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1863228988jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1863228988jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-800949186jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-800949186jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-80279040jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-80279040jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-875696345jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-875696345jpg.jpg) Later, we encountered a large amount of fallen bamboo. It was blocking our path. I was about to find my way under it when our guide pulled out a machete and hacked at it all until he had cleared a path for us. How kind of him. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-209677437jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-209677437jpg.jpg) At one of the last stops we noticed how quiet and peaceful it was. It was as if we had the whole area to ourselves (and maybe we did!?). The trees were creaking slightly in the gentle breeze, and some leaves rustled as they fell to the ground. We could also hear birds calling to each other. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-247346547jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-247346547jpg.jpg) The last part of the trek was downhill. For ages. Hard on the knees. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-351034896jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-351034896jpg.jpg) It was a relief to get to the final part of the trek. The guide and his friends asked us if we wanted to smoke (they had cigar type cigarettes which our guide was fond of). We declined, and instead watched them chill for a bit before they drove us in the ute back to meet the van. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1705807519jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1705807519jpg.jpg) When we got back to our hotel we tried out the pool to cool off, but found out it was actually _too_ cold! Later in the evening we met up with my Dad, his wife, and Mari who's 10. It was a nice dinner at a French place, but I'm glad we finished our main course _before_ the power cut!! To round off the evening: we were almost back to our accommodation when we got a call from the restaurant. It was very confusing because they were saying we had left either soap or candles. We thought this was weird, but we walked back to check it out. Luckily they were soaps that belonged to our group. Goodnight all. ~Kimmie
