It turns out that the morning of the 6th of November is not a good morning to get up early. We had a 3am start, but were kept awake most of the night by fireworks! You might recall that on our Japan trip we took one bag between us. We tried to also pack light for this trip (Kimmie is becoming masterful at this :) ). Our bags totalled less than 10kg! The flights were pretty uneventful, although Kimmie didn't like the service on our first Qantas flight. None of the staff seemed very happy, and we could see the people unloading the bags just tossing them about.

The staff didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. The flight was an interesting one because we almost had the plane to ourselves. No wonder the flight was cheap!

This was a one hour trip. Not exactly a relaxing one either as there don't seem to be many road rules over here (we saw a car drive into oncoming traffic in order to overtake!!). Our driver was also very distracted by his cellphone. After travelling over 10,000km it is time for some well deserved sleep I think. See y'all tomorrow. - Jason
