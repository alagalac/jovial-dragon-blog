This morning we woke up a bit later. We dropped Mari off at her school and then went on a walk with Armine. We went to a local cafe and grabbed a cup of coffee.Â  [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1426298552jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1426298552jpg.jpg) Continuing onwards, we stopped off at a local bakery we saw for breakfast. This was a fairly posh bakery. We even had a doorman inspect our bags before entering. Inside they had a wide variety of breads and treats. Since Thanksgiving is coming up you could order a roast turkey, although it costs 7,900 baht (over $300 NZD!).

On our way there we were crossing a road at a pedestrian crossing when suddenly the lights changed and suddenly about 200 mopeds were bearing down in us. we scrambled back to the footpath and had to wait five minutes for the lights to change again. It was a very posh supermarket with a wide range of imported international goods. We also saw a few interesting things such as apples for $20 NZD each.

We saw NZ Manuka honey selling for up to $200 NZD a pot, although this was locked away behind a glass screen!

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-51199787jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-51199787jpg.jpg) I won't bore you with details of the shopping, but the mall had a bit of a sleezy vibe. Everything looked nice initially, but if you looked a bit closer it was all a bit dodgy. For example, a restaurant would look nice, but the bathrooms were tucked away down a back alley. The floors would look nice, but the ceiling was a tangle of wires. Some of the shops looked nice, but then there was a labyrinth of tiny market stalls around the corner. For lunch we went to the "International food court". They operated a cashless system where you charged everything to a card and settled the bill at the end. It felt like a bit of a system to encourage you to spend money without realising how much you were spending. We almost ended up spending about $30 for lunch between two people, which is quite a bit by Thai standards. They also weren't transparent about the service charges, and were encouraging people to rate them on trip advisor by offering free drinks. When I finally went to pay, the cashier snatched away the notes as I was counting out the money. While the food was OK, it seemed like a bit of a cash grab operation.

I reached my hand into my pocket, and felt a 20 baht note, which I swear was not there before. I thought that maybe somebody had slipped it into my pocket while I wasn't watching. By this point I was paranoid that the local Mafia was out to get us and so we hightailed it out of there! ðŸ˜œ We caught the BTS skytrain back home. It was very hot and humid. It was only about 2pm but it was very packed and people were only just able to squeeze on. Armine made us a delicious Indian dish for dinner, accompanied by yummy homemade strawberry lassi. - Jason
