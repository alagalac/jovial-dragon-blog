This morning we got up early to see if the local bakery was open, since it was closed yesterday. The bakery was again not open, so we visited Je caf√© across the road to wait until opening time (yesterday they told us it opens at 10am, even though the sign clearly had it as opening at 8am). 10am soon rolled around, and the bakery was still firmly closed. Hungry for breakfast and still not trusting any of the Indian-Italian-Thai restaurants, we went to the lowest common denominator: McDonalds. I know people complain about tourists going to a new country and then visiting McDonalds, but honestly sometimes when you're hungry, tired, and want to go somewhere where at least you know what you're getting it can be the best option. We were amused menu items on offer e.g. pepper chicken burger and spinach pie. To fill out the morning we went back to the Monkey Trail for a bit of a walk. The trail is very dodgy and involved walking up a bunch of uneven wooden steps. It was evidently too hot for the monkeys and they didn't come out this time, although Kimmie spotted one in the bushes.

It was still closed. Next up we caught a "bus" (actually a mini van shuttle) to the airport for our flight up to Chiang Mai. Krabi airport is supposed to be an up-and-coming international airport. From what we saw, it's definitely second-rate! Before checking in, everybody had to join a long line to have our checked-in luggage x-rayed and yellow stickered, although it looked like nobody really cared about the process.

They had three domestic departure gates, all situated right next to one another causing huge confusion whenever more than one plane was boarding. Two of the gates were actually the same gate. They didn't have enough air bridges for all of the planes, so we were crammed on to a bus which ferried us for 30 seconds across the runway to where we boarded our plane while it was starting to spit with rain. Arriving in Chiang Mai was very hectic. There was no real public transport, and not enough taxis for all of the passengers arriving, so we had to wait in line for an hour (after waiting in anothor line previously) just to catch a taxi. Kimmie found everything to be very inefficient and not well thought out (e.g. loy krathong/yi peng festival nights should have more transport available such as buses). When we arrived at our hotel we quickly dumped our bags and headed off towards Narawat Bridge where the Yi Peng lanterns were being let off. The whole festival was pretty disorganised with no traffic management or crowd control in place. We had a very hard time just finding where to actually buy the lanterns and where to let them off.

This again was also crowded and required patience. The wind was also annoying and it was hard to keep the candles and incense sticks burning.
