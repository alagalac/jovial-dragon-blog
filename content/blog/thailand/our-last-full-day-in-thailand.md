....and we didn't really know what to do with ourselves! So we found the top rated coffee roastery on TripAdvisor and started our day there. TripAdvisor is very handy - we never would have found this place ourselves. It was on a random little street that didn't look like it had much down it!

We saw that they also offer roastery tours which would have been cool to go on. We walked past a cafe I had kept seeing and craving. They sold all these yummy things on toast. E.g. strawberries and ricotta. So we went there for a snack... and we shared another well known coffee brand here.

So we had a 1 hour aromatherapy relaxation massage. It was mostly relaxing apart from near the end when I was afraid she was going to twist me, or dig into me, a little too much. Suffice to say we preferred our Fah Lanna massage in Chiang Mai. Dad met us after our massage and showed us Little Arabia. We saw shops selling button shoes, bark, incense, crockery and other knick knacks. There were also several restaurants about and the architecture was quite varied.

I couldn't pass by this cute inside ice cream truck without trying one. I kept seeing this truck, and I decided that I might as well try one as it's not as if we can get them back home. We tried a "milk and cream" ice cream. I was sceptical, but I ended up really liking it. Jase wondered why we didn't have plain milk flavoured ice cream back home.

Safe work practices for sure. :/ There was hardly any room for their feet on that ledge!!

Thanks to Armine for all her hard work in preparing everything. Very yummy. There was even Armenian wine on offer! :) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1337198532jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1337198532jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-87538678jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-87538678jpg.jpg) We spent a good amount of time attempting to pack up our bags this afternoon. It was a bit overwhelming, especially with all my Chutuchuck purchases yesterday. Somehow I think I managed OK with my small bag! Success!

Goodnight! -Kimmie **P.s:** On a random note, check out these elevator buttons. What's up with the multiple missing numbers? Surely it's not all for superstitious reasons?
