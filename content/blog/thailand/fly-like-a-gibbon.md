This morning we did something a bit different and didn't visit Caf√© Arte. Instead we stopped over at Fahtara Coffee for breakfast. We had some gorgeous coconut and mango French toast.

Over about three hours we swung through the rainforest on cables from one tree to the next. The platforms were all quite high off the ground! While on the course we managed to spot a few of the eponymous Gibbons hiding up in the trees. The could swing and bounce from branch to branch amazingly quickly and gracefully. They made loud high pitched Ooooo-we sounds.

One of the lines was really long (over 800 metres!) and you went really fast.

It was kind of funny after this one as our guide asked whether we were twins!

This one was quite freaky as you had to jump off the platform into thin air.

I deliberately tried to shake them as much as possible!

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2058992673jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2058992673jpg.jpg) After finally getting back on solid ground we headed back to the main village for a decidedly average Thai meal (the chicken was very dry, and there was a weird mushroom dish. We cooked better Thai food ourselves the other day!). On the way back to Chiang Mai we stopped at a waterfall for some photos, however this waterfall was much less impressive than the one we saw on our hike yesterday.

Yeah... Lots of spooky organ music, howling at the moon, and rapping with western swearwords thrown in at random. Back in Chiang Mai we chilled out for a bit and then went back to Fahtara Coffee for dinner. The place is attached to an up-market day spa and so was decorated quite nicely. - Jason
