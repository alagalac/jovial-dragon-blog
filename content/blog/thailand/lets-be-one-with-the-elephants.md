G'day all. It's Kimmie again. Jase will blog tomorrow since we'll be doing an activity that Jase chose and that he wants to blog about. Today we visited theÂ [Elephant Nature Park](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org). We chose this activity because of its ethical nature. It's basically a sanctuary for disable/rescued elephants. You don't ride the elephants here and they aren't forced to perform. Usually if you visit the park as a day visitor you are put into groups and you can feed the elephants behind lines on a platform. You are also shepherded around the park with a guide. We wanted a more personal and interactive experience. So while it's more than twice the price of just a day visit, paying a bit extra to take part in a nearby Elephant Nature Park endorsed project means you get to:

*   Walk alongside the elephants
*   Feed and touch them up close
*   Watch them foraging in the jungle naturally
*   Eat in the jungle above a river
*   Go on a jungle hike
*   Bathe the elephants in a natural flowing river
*   Have a personal tour guide and help out a local conservation project
*   Be in a small group (ours was 11 people).

We chose the 'Care for Elephants' package, which is run by a local guy called Ben. **Our day with the elephants** We were picked up in a mini van. It was a 1 hour trip. On the way they showed us a film about some of the ways elephants are mistreated.

Asian elephants curl their trunks around food. We fed the elephants a selection of fruit and veg such as watermelon, cucumber, pumpkin, and banana. Later on we also fed them supplement tablets, which instead of grabbing they hoovered up like vacuum cleaners!

We were lucky enough to get to hang out with a baby elephant on our project (Lucky is 3 years and 8 months old. He likes being mischievous and made funny noises similar to that of a sealion). Our guide, who told us to call him 'sunshine', was more then happy to answer our questions, and also had a good sense of humour. **Fun fact**: An elephant costs about $28,000 NZD to buy. Here's us walking with the elephants on our way into the jungle. The elephants had their carers (mahouts) with them too.

We were surrounded by bamboo, stinging nettle, and other plants. There were ants, bugs, sandflies, water buffalo and other wildlife around. **Fun fact**: Apparently if an elephant is sick and needs to go to a hospital it will be looking for, and want to be with, it's manhout. The two form a bond/friendship.

A few of the property's dogs also followed us. We also had a pit stop where the elephants went off and looked for the own food (to reduce human dependence). **Fun fact**: Elephants have bad peripheral vision. We had to be careful where we stood.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-833074326jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-833074326jpg.jpg) Lunch was a very lovely buffet in the jungle. They also boiled water in a traditional pot over a fire so we could have hot drinks. Our guide went through all the food and drink on offer, even the most obvious as a joke. e.g he picked up the spoons and told us they were spoons. We ate with our feet dangling over the balcony of the little jungle hut while watching the river below. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1691320282jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1691320282jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1960566731jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1960566731jpg.jpg) After lunch we got to bathe the elephants. We waded into the river, which flowed quite fast and was deep in places. The elephants did not appear for about 10 minutes so we just had to wait in the river and avoid floating objects. We got a bit of a fright whenever a stick or something else hit out feet/ankles. When the elephants came, they initially didn't want us to wash them. They were more interested in the grassy food on the other side of the river bank! When they did come over we used buckets to throw water over them. Our group was spread around the elephants and of course this meant that if you threw with too much vigour you'd get someone wet. I managed to stay dry until about 5 minutes before we were to go back on land and then someone got me all wet!! Somehow Jase managed to avoid this. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1175603144jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1175603144jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1836436901jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1836436901jpg.jpg) As you can see from the pictures we walked through a variety of terrains, but the most annoying were the many muddy areas. We all tried not to fall over or step in a deep area. Check out the size of those footprints. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1064094107jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1064094107jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-366905987jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-366905987jpg.jpg) Jase didn't have any problems with the mud. Unfortunately for me, and I was doing so well until near the end, when I got stuck in some deep mud. I had to leave my shoes and then reach in to rescue them. For some reason I found it hilarious at the time. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-367595764jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-367595764jpg.jpg) As punishment I had to, by myself, bathe in the river a bit and wash my shoes off before continuing (river wash of shame!! Haha). We rounded off the day by having an after-hour tour of the main Elephant Nature Park. We got to go up close to a herd of 8 elephants including a 7month old baby. Apparently this herd has the most amount of natural instinct. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-580045935jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-580045935jpg.jpg) Caring for the elephants today was a special and unique experience. It was really awesome to be so close to them. It felt good to do something more natural and to be a responsible/ethical tourist. We'd encourage anyone coming to Chiang Mai to participate in one of these projects. I didn't even get very sunburned (first sunburn of the trip! :/ ) or eaten alive by bugs. Horaah. :) For dinner we at a place called the Cat House. It had lots of vegan, vegetarian etc style food. We thought the pineapple basil smoothie and the coconut pie were good.
