Sawasdee. Today was a "chill out" day. We basically meandered around town and stumbled upon/tried random things. We slept in until about 9am (so amazing) and then went out for a coffee. There are so many caf√© choices here, but today we chose _Macchiato house and Cakebox_. It was lovely. Nice quality coffee and man, my breakfast was awesome. I ordered a Japanese maple toast dish (the recommend dish). ¬†See for yourself below.

We found the post box and were ready to put the postcards into the box when a lady in a nearby shop said something to us. She was indicating that we should post them in their plastic sleeves. We didn't know that, and of course had thrown ours away as we thought they were rubbish! Luckily the lady was kind enough to give us some for free. She also said she'd post them for us. I didn't hear what she said about 5pm, but I trust that she'll send them for us. Here's a picture of me before I almost posted the postcards, and then didn't...!

Check out these nice tiles.

I was a bit concerned for their safety!

It was a kind of claustrophobic, but also a bit of a novelty.

It was funky and made me think that Wellington needs to step up its caf√© game! I had this interesting "magic drink", which had ice with pansies inside it and the glass was drizzled with honey. I enjoyed the presentation of this purple concoction.

They offered such interesting tapa-style choices. We'd have loved to have come back and tried these if we'd had more time.

On the way there a guy asked why we were walking where we were as there was "nothing over there". Gosh, are tourists not allowed to go to non-tourist areas or something? One cool thing about the cashew factory (below) is that they give you a demo of how a cashew is opened.

We bought some unusual local fruit to try and I also bought a USA brand of togs. The togs were originally priced at 3,050 baht ($120nzd), reduced to 850 baht, and then for some reason the girl told me they were now 299 baht (about $12nzd). Bargain!?! After all that excitement we decided to go back to our hotel for a swim. We had the pool to ourselves, which awesomely has been the case each time we've wanted to use our hotel pools! This is our hotel's little pool. You access it via spiral staircase! üèä [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-180650273jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-180650273jpg.jpg) When we got back to our room Jase had fun checking out the "singles day" sales online. I didn't know such a day existed, but apparently there are great deals to be had! Dinner was nice and cheap. Oh my goodness, 99 baht ($4 nzd) happy hour cocktails (happy hour here actually lasts multiple hours)! So amazing. Cocktails are so overpriced back home!!! :-( üç∏üçπ [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-939608244jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-939608244jpg.jpg) The streets here are pretty at night...

Goodnight. -Kimmie
