Hello all. Today was our last day in Chiang Mai. We were a bit sad to leave as we've enjoyed our time here. We also loved our cute guest house.

Jase decided that the flat white was pretty close to Wellington quality. I enjoyed a homemade hawaiian bagel and jase had their signature French toast.

It was called [Fah Lanna](http://www.fahlanna.com/). This spa is more expensive than all of the other massage places we've been to (it is like the equivalent of a posh day spa such as East Day Spa, but a fraction of the price). We definitely thought the extra price was worth it. I loved the beautiful landscaping and decorations. Even the toilets were beautiful.

It was a nice way to end the experience. With Jase all loosened up and me with blue toenails, we headed back towards our hotel. Finally, we had the chance to visit [Khunkae Juice Bar](https://m.facebook.com/pages/Khun-Kaes-Juice-Bar/1689961967906460). This place was one I'd had my eye on as it was highly rated on Tripadvisor. Each time we'd passed by previously it was closed or packed with people.

There we saw some scary monster ants. I think they were red weaver ants.

Bye bye Chiang Mai. We took an AirAsia flight. I find this airline to be very commercial, always with ads and trying to sell merchandise to customers.

Took about 20 minutes for us to get a taxi. We had to wait for our number to appear on the screen.

It's called Omni Tower.
