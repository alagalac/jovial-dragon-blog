Hi all This morning we stumbled upon a new coffee place called [Alto Coffee Roasters](http://alto-coffee.com). They had a wide variety of flavours on offer such as salted caramel and tiramisu. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1214840831jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1214840831jpg.jpg) After this refreshing pitstop we got on the BTS skytrain, hopping off at Saphan Taksin. We then needed to get a ferry to Memorial Bridge. There were lots of people standing around trying to ask where you wanted to go. We found out this is a bit of a tourist trap. They were stopping people before they got to the proper ticket person. The prices quoted were 40-100 baht instead of the 14 we ended up paying. Here's what the real ticket counter looks like. Not exactly obvious.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1682601509jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1682601509jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1124617610jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1124617610jpg.jpg) We saw a wide range of buildings while on the boat. So many juxtapositions between old and brand new buildings. Some of the older ones looked like they needed to be demolished. Seems like there is a great ghost tour market ready and waiting for someone to profit from! [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1090577640jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1090577640jpg.jpg) Once on dry ground we were intrigued by our surroundings. We stumbled upon all sorts of interesting things. A monument: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-30670646jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-30670646jpg.jpg) A flower market: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-508597564jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-508597564jpg.jpg) A lady selling (expensive) strawberries: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1527217737jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1527217737jpg.jpg) We walked through an Indian market. There was a lot of jewellery, fabric and other sewing materials, and hair accessories in particular. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-682136737jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-682136737jpg.jpg) Walking down the streets outside the market we noticed that each street specialised in something. We saw a golden ornament street, wood street, metal street, car street... Here are some pictures from the golden ornament street. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-450570137jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-450570137jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1050624287jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1050624287jpg.jpg) There were lots of monks around. You could even buy the orange robes. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1731787217jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1731787217jpg.jpg) We stopped off for a drink and some lunch at a place called [Old Town Cafe](https://m.facebook.com/OldTownCafeBangkok). They specialised in baguettes, similar in style to Ban Mi. Funny that, considering they didn't really give you any other choice on their menu. The style of the place was quirky, but we weren't allowed to take pictures. After lunch we walked to the Giant Swing, one of the icons of Bangkok. Jase was intrigued by the weird merchandise nearby. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1821447166jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1821447166jpg.jpg) The swing itself is smaller than I'd imagined. Not overly exciting either. It's in the middle of a busy roundabout. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-395533493jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-395533493jpg.jpg) Next up was the 'Golden Mount', a nearby temple with 344 steps to its summit. It also boasts a great 360 view. On our way to the Mount we had to cross a busy road. It seemed impossible to cross. I noticed a man cross with a red flag. He put it in a cylinder box near us that said "safety". Apparently this was the vital instrument you needed to use to be able to cross! Funny solution to the problem. Annoyingly there was only one flag too, so you have to be on the flag side or else you might be there a while like we almost were. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1505286248jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1505286248jpg.jpg) We enjoyed the Mount's cheap entry fee (20 baht/80cents in NZD). There were also other cool decorations around the place. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1470077139jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1470077139jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1880566217jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1880566217jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-856655007jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-856655007jpg.jpg) Lots of bells and gongs too. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-161531646jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-161531646jpg.jpg) Inside, there were a lot of gold budda. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-536670337jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-536670337jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-932454352jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-932454352jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1264128426jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1264128426jpg.jpg) Outside, a giant gold bell, and those great views I mentioned before. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1266621414jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1266621414jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2086478512jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2086478512jpg.jpg) At the foot of the Mount there was a story about how disease once went through the area and affected many people (1 in 10). They couldn't deal with so many victims so some were left out for the vultures. At the bottom of the Mount we found out that there is a cemetery. Chinatown time! This place was full of alleyways that you could browse for ages. Lots of random bits-and-bobs shops, with many selling gold jewellery. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1146639983jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1146639983jpg.jpg) Randomly we saw a pug getting a blow-dry....!? [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-979975597jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-979975597jpg.jpg) Once we'd finished in Chinatown we attempted to find the MRT underground train. It was hard to find in comparison to the BTS. We saw this on the way. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-944881594jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-944881594jpg.jpg) We liked how you get little black plastic tokens instead of tickets for the MRT. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2109935096jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2109935096jpg.jpg) We finished up the day wandering around in Terminal 21 mallband enjoying a drink at the bar on the 5th floor. We liked this mall's international/airport theme. Each floor was a different country (well almost, there seemed to be several American floors). [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-181588789jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-181588789jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-607048738jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-607048738jpg.jpg) We'll probably be back again to wander the shops at Terminal 21. Tomorrow we will be watching a movie at the theatre here. Cheap Wednesdays (100 baht/$4 NZD)! -Kimmie
