Hi all. I love a good alliteration, don't you? :) Yesterday at lunchtime we were somewhat impulsive and bought a tour online. I always planned to show Jase Phang Nga Bay, but the weather forecast looked very dire for the rest of this week (thunderstorms were predicted for almost every day). Bad weather does not make for the best outdoor experiences. While I was uncertain about booking a tour (as they were all around 3,200 baht online or in person, or approx $125nzd per person), I still really wanted to go to Phang Nga Bay. I decided that you can't come all the way to Phuket and not see it. Also, I observed that the weather forecasts had not been very accurate so far. Jase found a cheap tour online which piqued my interest. It was only 1,400 baht ($55nzd) as there was a 50% off sale. But you know the saying that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is? I was concerned that perhaps it was a scam, but I'm glad we took the risk as the age-old saying didn't apply in this instance! **Today's adventure** This morning we were picked up at about 7.30am from our hotel in this amazing van, which can only be described as a white leather party/disco van. It looked very new and had wonderful aircon. I enjoyed how we were silently partying our way to the pier. ![](http://i0.wp.com/jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1043577733jpg.jpg?w=792) I was worried this morning when several people on the tour were late and held us up. The tour was meant to start at 9am but we didn't even arrive at the pier until about 9.15am. The arrival area also seemed a bit dodge, as we joined a group of people who looked as if they had already been sitting there for a wee while. They ushered us to form a line and write our names down for "insurance". It seemed very ad hoc. In any case, we followed their instructions and waited by the little shop for further instructions. The tour company, BJ Canoeing Tour, took us on the following route (which included round trip transport to and from our hotel): Por Pier --> Panak Island --> James Bond Island -->Koh Panyee fishing village--> Hong Island -->  Naka Island--> Por Pier. We were in the blue team and were given blue wristbands. This made it much easier to identify people in our group, which had less than 25 people in it. When we got on the speedboat our guide Abraham indicated that Jase and I should take the front row seats. This turned out to be awesome, and we think we got the best seats. Not only did we have a good view, leg room, and storage area to ourselves, but we also had shade. Several others were at the front of the boat which most likely would have been horrible for us and resulted in terrible sunburn.

They also provided us with refreshments which was awesome. We had an on-board photographer who followed our group around all day. He was really nice and we ended up buying a CD with his photos of us on it. I enjoyed the breeze generated by the speedboat. So amazing on a warm day! _Panak Island_ Our first stop was a small island. A few monkeys greeted us.

We had to be careful where we stood as there were some sharp rocks. A few people cut themselves but luckily our guide had first aid supplies on board. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1925904821jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1925904821jpg.jpg) Once through the cave we came out at this awesome circular area with tree roots and tall cliffs. Apparently you have to time your trip to this place right otherwise it's underwater! [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-723406711jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-723406711jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-698679886jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-698679886jpg.jpg) We loved this place. It was peaceful and seemed ancient and full of wonder. We were actually scheduled to go to Hong Island next but they saw it was busy and said we'd come back later. This was quite sensible and I was impressed by their initiative.   [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1218587348jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1218587348jpg.jpg) _James Bond Island_ Next stop was the famous James Bond Island. Famous for featuring in the movie _The Man with the Golden Gun_. I recall this island being a bit of a tourist trap last time I was here, but this time it wasn't too bad. We got some good pictures (the photographer got some great and very corney ones of us too!) but glad we didn't stay too long.

Over 1,600 people live there (about 360 families) and apparently lots of the men leave the village each day to go out and work nearby e.g. as canoe paddlers.

We were also escorted through their on-site preschool/primary school which seemed weird. The kids appeared to be used to having tourists come through though. The lunch buffet was not bad. Afterwards we had a look at some of the shops. They sold lots of pearls and other knick knacks. _Hong Island_ We enjoyed our kayak around this island with our own personal kayak guide. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-924119238jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-924119238jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1353205835jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1353205835jpg.jpg) Apparently the island is home to about 100 monkeys who arrived there by swimming. The caves we paddled through were also home to many bats. I got to have a go with the paddle, and our guide gave us an interesting local fruit to try. I think he was joking when he mentioned anaconda snakes in the water...! _Naka Island_ Our guide called this 'party island' because there are bars selling cocktails. You can also jetski and parasail. I had a wonderfully relaxing time here sipping a huge, delicious, pina colada in a coconut, while burying my feet in the soft powdery white sand.

I saw lots of fish from the shore. This place would be such a paradise if it weren't for the people who kept coming up to everyone to try and sell things. **To sum up...** We had a really awesome, long, and relaxing day. I do wish some of the people on our boat had been less obnoxious and more environmentally friendly. I got pretty upset when I saw one of them throw rubbish over our boat. I told him off but I doubt he cared. :( Dinner tonight was at a place called Elephant Cafe. Who knew you could get such good lasagna in Phuket of all places? Tomorrow we're off to Phuket Town. Night! -Kimmie
