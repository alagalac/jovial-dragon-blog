Today we explored the part beach of Patong.

Mango for breakfast
-------------------

First thing this morning we headed down to Mr Coffee, our favourite little Italian cafe. It's only about a five minute walk, and they have lots of yummy fresh baked goods. It's a bit expensive by Thai standards but is really tasty. Kimmie ordered a fresh mango. \[caption id="attachment_2368" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie's fresh mango.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_091314-600x450.jpg) Kimmie's fresh mango.\[/caption\] After breakfast we headed back down to the same massage place we went to yesterday. Kimmie order an aromatherapy massage meanwhile I opted for the Thai massage. You have to do it while in Thailand, right? \[caption id="attachment_2370" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Outside the massage place.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_101051-600x450.jpg) Outside the massage place.\[/caption\] I don't know if it's because I'm flexible from yoga, or if they just went easy on the skinny white guy, but the Thai massage was actually pretty gentle. During the massage they said "Good night" and "Good morning" when they put on and took off the towels over our eyes, which we found funny.

Over the hill to Patong
-----------------------

After massage time it was taxi time. We caught a taxi (I refuse to call then tuk tuks because they don't make the tuk tuk sound) over to Patong. It cost 400 baht ($16), which was quite a lot, but taxis are expensive around Phuket. \[caption id="attachment_2371" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Sitting in the "tuk tuk".](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_114910-600x450.jpg) Sitting in the "tuk tuk".\[/caption\] We got off at Jungceylon, a large shopping mall. \[caption id="attachment_2372" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The entrance to the mall.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_154525-600x450.jpg) The entrance to the mall.\[/caption\] We spent most of the afternoon wandering around the mall. Kimmie bought a new dress. We almost bought some cute owl pillows, but couldn't find the ones we liked. \[caption id="attachment_2373" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Kimmie's gone dress shopping.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_152848-600x450.jpg) Kimmie's gone dress shopping.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_2374" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![They love their owls!](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_132621_1-600x450.jpg) They love their owls!\[/caption\] Next up, we decided to take a stroll down the infamous Bangla Road. \[caption id="attachment_2375" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Walking down the road.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_162309-600x450.jpg) Walking down the road.\[/caption\]

Bangala Road
------------

Bangla Road is the centre of the Patong nightlife, and it makes Courtenay Place look like lollipops playland. There's hundreds of bars and nightclubs lining the street. The two largest clubs Illuzion and Tiger face opposite each other blasting music in a 'battle of the clubs' formation. We stopped off at Tiger for a beer. \[caption id="attachment_2376" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![The tiger club.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_161245-600x450.jpg) The tiger club.\[/caption\] It's hard to describe how huge this place is. The ground floor alone could hold at least a thousand people. The ground floor was laid out around about 40 individual bars, which apparently people could just rent and start serving alcohol from. \[caption id="attachment_2377" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Inside the tiger club.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_155424-600x450.jpg) Inside the tiger club.\[/caption\] They had large tiger statues lining the walls. \[caption id="attachment_2378" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Lots of tigers.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_160131-600x450.jpg) Lots of tigers.\[/caption\] Further down Bangla Road there were a variety of bars, a McDonald's (which must do a roaring trade), and a couple of shooting ranges because what better entertainment exists for a bunch of drunk people? \[caption id="attachment_2379" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![An Aussie bar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_162146-600x450.jpg) An Aussie bar.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_2380" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A moulin rouge bar.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_162224-600x450.jpg) A moulin rouge bar.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment_2381" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![A shooting range?](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_162036-600x450.jpg) A shooting range?\[/caption\] Along the way we grabbed a coconut ice cream, however somehow Kimmie ended up with the ice cream and I was left with the free coconut water. \[caption id="attachment_2382" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![Yummy coconut icecream.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_161907-600x450.jpg) Yummy coconut ice-cream.\[/caption\] Patong beach was just as crazy, but in a different way. The beach was very crowded and we were almost bowled over by the paragliders coming into land. \[caption id="attachment_2383" align="aligncenter" width="600"\][![Crazy paragliders.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_163437-600x450.jpg)](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_163437.jpg) Crazy paragliders.\[/caption\] If you look closely you'll see there's one person strapped into the paraglider, and then two people holding onto the ropes who jumped on as it was taking off. Getting tired of Patong, we taxied back to the much quieter Karon Beach where we are staying. We ended the day much like it started off with dinner and dessert at MrCoffee. \[caption id="attachment_2384" align="aligncenter" width="600"\]![There's always time for Mr Coffee.](http://coupleofkiwis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161108_190154-600x450.jpg) There's always time for Mr Coffee.\[/caption\]
