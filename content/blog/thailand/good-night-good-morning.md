First thing this morning we headed down to MrCoffee, our favourite little Italian cafe. It's only about a five minute walk, and they have lots of yummy fresh baked goods. It's a bit expensive by Thai standards but is really tasty. Kimmie ordered a fresh mango.

Kimmie order an aromatherapy massage meanwhile I opted for the Thai massage. You have to do it while in Thailand, right?

During the massage they said "Good night" and "Good morning" when they put on and took off the towels over our eyes, which we found funny. After massage time it was taxi time. We caught a taxi (I refuse to call then tuk tuks because they don't make the tuk tuk sound) over to Patong. It cost 400 baht ($16), which was quite a lot, but taxis are expensive around Phuket.

Kimmie bought a new dress. We almost bought some cute owl pillows, but couldn't find the ones we liked.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1446545004jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1446545004jpg.jpg) Bangla Road is the centre of the Patong nightlife, and it makes Courtenay Place look like lollipops playland. There's hundreds of bars and nightclubs lining the street. The two largest clubs Illuzion and Tiger face opposite each other blasting music in a 'battle of the clubs' formation. We stopped off at Tiger for a beer.

The ground floor alone could hold at least a thousand people. The ground floor was laid out around about 40 individual bars, which apparently people could just rent and start serving alcohol from.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1362775044jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1362775044jpg.jpg) Further down Bangla Road there was an Aussie bar (typical) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1794225591jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1794225591jpg.jpg) a moulin rouge bar [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1754185261jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1754185261jpg.jpg) a McDonald's (which must do a roaring trade), and a couple of shooting ranges because what better entertainment exists for a bunch of drunk people? [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-775138087jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-775138087jpg.jpg) Along the way we grabbed a coconut ice cream, however somehow Kimmie ended up with the ice cream and I was left with the free coconut water. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-864338692jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-864338692jpg.jpg) Patong beach was just as crazy, but in a different way. The beach was very crowded and we were almost bowled over by the paragliders coming into land. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1440576086jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1440576086jpg.jpg) If you look closely you'll see there's one person strapped into the paraglider, and then two people holding onto the ropes who jumped on as it was taking off. Getting tired of Patong, we taxied back to the much quieter Karon Beach where we are staying. We ended the day much like it started off with dinner and dessert at MrCoffee.
