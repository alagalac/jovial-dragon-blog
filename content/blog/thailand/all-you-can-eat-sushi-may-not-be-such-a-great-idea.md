G'day. Armine made us a delicious breakfast of pancakes and fruit. Yummy. Thanks Armine!

But first! Coffee. :) We tried a place called Doilanka.They use local organic beans. We thought the coffee was okay, but we wished they used double shots (the same for many places here). On our way to today's mall we passed another much fancier mall. We could tell the kind of customers that shop here by the cars that parked outside.

I didn't find anything I liked so I only bought food, but Jase got a good deal on some pants (2 for $32NZD!). For lunch we decided to try a place that looked very popular with locals - an all you can eat sushi train/buffet and DIY soup place.

Not because we ate too much (weirdly enough we didn't really feel full, even after trying everything). I think something we tried upset our tummy. :( After a bit of a sit down we tried a tiramisu ice cream which I spied when we first entered.
