This morning we made sure to only have a small breakfast at our local Cafe Arte. I did however have a "magic" coffee. Apparently this is a new style of coffee from Melbourne which is popular here. It tastes like a smaller, stronger, darker flat white. We had the smaller breakfast because today we went off to a full day cooking class at Thai Farm Cooking School.

What were the odds? We had fun chatting to them. We ticked off what we wanted to cook today.

Most of the vegetables were the same as what we'd find back home in our market. The main difference was the different types of mushrooms and eggplants. Well, that and the dried fish...

Our class was taught by Wass, who was pretty funny and always joking around. The first thing we had to prepare was the curry paste. We got to choose how many chillis we used. I used two chillis in my green curry paste, and I managed to convince Kimmie to have one chilli. We ground it all up in our mortar and pestle.

I made a Tom Yam soup while Kimmie made a coconut soup. They tasted really good. Our next course was spring rolls and pad Thai. When folding the spring rolls, Wass kept telling Kimmie to use more water. "Wetter is better!". For all of our meals we had garnishings to use, to fancy them up a bit.

We cooked curries using the curry paste we had prepared earlier, and then made stir-fried chicken basil and cashew nut dishes with some fresh picked long beans. This we served with sticky rice.

We boiled Sweat Pea flowers to colour the rice.

In the evening Kimmie was keen for another massage so we went back to Lila Thai Massage where they hire the ex-inmates. I had a foot and reflexology massage, which felt like it was mostly rubbing tiger balm into my calfs! Kimmie meanwhile had a nice relaxing facial, which also included an arm massage. - Jason
