Bright and early today we packed our bags and headed off to our new hotel on the other side of the island, in Phuket Town. Our taxi driver asked us "Why you go there? There not beaches in Phuket Town". Yes, but beaches can get a bit boring, and we like cafés. Phuket Town is the largest city in Phuket, although it's not that big. It also has a long history which we could see in the interesting buildings and architecture. We splashed out a bit here to stay at the Casa Blanca Boutique Hotel. It's a pretty cute hotel in an old sino-portugese building which Phuket Town is famous for.

We saw a lot more neat little cafés and restaurants which we'd be keen to try tomorrow. The place reminds me a bit of Cuba Street back home.

The show is a showcase of Thai culture. Before the show we had a good buffet dinner. I have a particular dilemma with buffets in that I have to try everything. Here there was so much choice of food that after trying most things I was absolutely stuffed! Interestingly there seemed to be some form of racial segregation going on and all of the European people were seated separately from the Asian people.

After a short while a thunderstorm came through and it started raining heavily.

There was what looked like a staged Thai boxing match, and some traditional Thai dancing. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-199202855jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-199202855jpg.jpg) I couldn't take any pictures of the actual main show itself because they were very strict about no recording equipment. As in, my bags were thoroughly searched and I was given a patdown to make sure I absolutely didn't have a camera on me. However somehow they were all good with me taking in my phone. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Inside the theatre we had a Thai power ballad commemorating the king playing, followed by advertising for Chang beer. Just before the performance we had to stand for the national anthem, although it was a little odd that they played an instrumental version given the audience were all tourists and so nobody knew the words. The show itself was pretty good. The first half was a bit of a simplified Thai history lesson, while the second half was about Thai beliefs about heaven and hell. The best scene was the heaven scene where they had a lot of smoke on the ground and performers floating about the stage on wires. The show was pretty impressive with all of the detailed costumes, sets, and the fact that they had a mini river running through the stage. During the half time interlude an audience member invited in stage almost fell into it! Back at our hotel there's currently a thunderstorm, but no rain yet. We went out for a short walk to see what the town looks like at night.
