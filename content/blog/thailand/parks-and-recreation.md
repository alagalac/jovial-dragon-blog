This morning we didn't really know what to do with ourselves. It seems that we've basically done Bangkok. All of the "Top things to to in Bangkok" lists are basically the same:

*   Visit the golden palace (not really too keen at the moment what with recent events in Thailand)
*   Visit China Town (done)
*   See reclining Buddha (have seen enough Buddhas)
*   Take a river cruise (done)
*   Try street food (most of it looks very unhygienic and smells bad!)
*   Go shopping (have been doing this for the past three days!)
*   Visit Lumphini Park (done)
*   Go on a tuktuk (Have done this before, and the tuktuk drivers here are very annoying).

Sick of sitting around the apartment I suggested we just go and grab a coffee and reassess the situation. On the way to the cafe we got to see how the local council maintains the pot plants attached to the street lights. A truck drives slowly past while somebody just leans out and throws a bucket of water at the plants.

We Â visited the same park where we tried out the hoverboarding yesterday, since it was close. Benjakitti Park is an interesting park. It's very rectangular, and Kimmie commented that it reminded her of Central Park. Most of the park is taken up by a large lake with a footpath and cycleway around the outside. The trees which were planted were not very big (Only planted about 10 years ago) and so didn't provide much shade.

It was only 40 baht (less than $2) and we had time to kill so we thought why not and rented one.

The water was very murky, but we did see a few creatures in the water at a distance. They were probably either fish or monitor lizards. Around the outside of the park they had some interesting outdoor gym equipment which we had a go on. It was a good idea and it'd be nice if they did something similar back home.

When we got there we saw that the burgers were quite expensive at 400 baht (on average a meal in Thailand is about 200 baht). However it was very hot in the sun and we didn't want to walk elsewhere so we ended up eating there. It's funny because back home in NZ I wouldn't blink at spending $16 on a burger! The waiter convinced me to get the Manhattan Monster burger. I immediately regretted my decision after seeing it.

At the station we were distracted by the Emporium, a mall next door. This mall looked pretty flash with lots of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci on the outside, so we thought we'd check it out. Inside the mall it was very posh with lots of very expensive shops. I felt like I was bringing the place down wandering in with a t-shirt, shorts, sandals, and a baseball cap.

The garden had some really good lookout points over the city. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-867145779jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-867145779jpg.jpg) The gardens even had a small rope course. Only for kids unfortunately! [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1332633327jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1332633327jpg.jpg) Further up the gardens there were some big, almost bird cage like structures with seats inside, where we stopped for a break. One thing we marvelled at in the mall was all of the people employed to do niche jobs. There were elevator-men to take you to your floor, there were doormen outside many of the shops to open the door, there were leaf-men picking up leaves in the garden area (it's autumn here), and when it started raining there were umbrella-men to ferry people between covers. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2018753285jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-2018753285jpg.jpg) By the time we were to head home a tropical thunderstorm had moved in and it was bucketing down. Abandoning the earlier plans for the body museum, we headed home. As if out of nowhere, hawkers had immediately sprung up selling umbrellas to people caught without one. Fortunately, we had our pink umbrella Kimmie bought in Phuket with us, and so we trudged back home in the rain along the uneven footpaths dodging the puddles. Maybe we've seen most of the major tourist attractions in Bangkok, but there's still a lot of random little interesting things to see. - Jason
