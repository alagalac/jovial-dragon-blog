This morning started off a bit slowly. We didn't really do much before 11am. However there was a reason for that (besides last night). Today we were going to the Chatuchak Market, and it doesn't really open until later. Chatuchak (or Jatujak) Market is the biggest market in Thailand, and one of the largest in the world. This market extends over 27 acres, and has over 15,000 stalls. It is big.

He works for ICAO, part of the UN dealing with international airspace. The building was quite interesting as it had a full United Nations conference room with the chairs for each country. It also had a mini museum of the gifts given by various countries.

In four hours we only covered a fraction of the market. Not everything for sale at the market was particularly legal either. A few of the stores had areas around the back where for example rare coral and fish were trafficked. It felt like the type of market where you could buy a spare kidney if you knew who to talk to! In the pet area they had honestly the cutest, fluffiest, puppies we'd ever seen. Kimmie's heart melted looking at them!

You could buy both clown fish (Nemo fish) and blue tangs (Dory fish). You could even buy a baby lobster in a bag!

We also saw a few tortoises, hedgehogs, piglets, and even a meerkat of all things. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1567306884jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1567306884jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-395744064jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-395744064jpg.jpg) The pet area of the market felt a bit cruel at times with all of the animals packed into small artificial enclosures, and the puppies looking very young to be separated from their parents. This was probably why a lot of the stalls had signs up saying no photos. I almost wanted to buy some of the animals just to release them.

We found a stall selling fresh mango juice.

It mostly consisted of breads with meats, salads, and hummus.
