Good morning :) We were out late last night so I didn't get a chance to blog. Yesterday began with an early start to go and watch Mari play netball. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-130982475jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-130982475jpg.jpg) After netball we chilled out and had lunch back at Dad's place. We also tried out their building's pool. The big pool was quite deep, we couldn't touch the bottom without some effort.

Dad and Armine had been telling us about how she gives good head massages when she washes hair. It took us a while to find the place, but when we did the two ladies were welcoming and friendly. I can attest to the fact that the scalp massages in fact good. And long. In her eagerness, the shampoo got in my ears and all over my shoulders, but I didn't mind. I think that most things can be forgiven when you're getting a great head massage. :) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-660721389jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-660721389jpg.jpg) After what was at least an hour of washing, drying, styling, cutting, blow-drying AND straightening the end result was this. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1445717409jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1445717409jpg.jpg) Pretty good for $16NZD! In Wellington central a good woman's haircut is at least $50. That's without a wash or anything! We went on a walk after to complete a mission. Jase wanted to try a charcoal croissant. They seem to be popular over here. We found one and I picked up a strawberry juice at the same time. Jase took this ad-like picture of me with said items.

The juice tasted amaaazing. Would recommend. On closer inspection, it appears they add a magical ingredient that makes up the invisible 10%. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1883867467jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1883867467jpg.jpg) On our way to dinner a loud truck passed us with booming loudspeakers. It was in Thai so we couldn't understand, but apparently they were advertising their fruit!? We had dinner at a place called Monsoon. It was very delicious.

This local watering hole is particularly well known by the expat crowd. It's also being demolished at some point too apparently. :/ [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1965364395jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1965364395jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1893310082jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1893310082jpg.jpg) We saw an alley cat lookalike of Jase's parents cat, Freddie. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-565757144jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-565757144jpg.jpg) We then grabbed a taxi (with a taxi driver who was quite funny!) to the Banyan Tree. On the 61st floor is an amazing restaurant and bar. Great views of Bangkok. We tried some expensive cocktails and admired the view. The drinks were about three times what you'd normally pay in Thailand, but I guess you were paying for the view. Somehow we managed to get corner seats!!

A beautiful gentle breeze and nice atmosphere. We could see the stars (not so easy in Bangkok) and watch planes fly by. I saw some birds fly by, which initially looked like shooting stars (I swear at least one was though!). The restaurant looked so romantic. But obviously it's very expensive (about $600 for dinner for two). We'd heard that it's best to just come for the cocktails though. We finished off the day with a walk-by of Soi Cowboy. Interesting to check out the girls outside.
