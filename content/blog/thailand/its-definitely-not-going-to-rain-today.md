Well, that's the last time I listen to weatherman Jason. I was about to pack an umbrella in our daypack today because I like to be prepared. But because it was hot and sunny outside (about 30 degrees) Jase assured me it wouldn't rain and therefore we wouldn't need it. Hmm... But before I launch into that, I actually was a bit freaked out this morning because my neck was quite sore after a neck/head massage from yesterday. It seems that it's definitely a lucky dip with massages here. I had to get some pain killers to help relieve the pain. Even now I can't make any sudden neck movements.  :'( **Railay Beach** We got a long tail boat (Jase observed that these sound as if they have airplane engines. They also emit black smoke which can't be good for the environment!!) to get to Railay.

In small outbursts at first, and then it bucketed down!  Good thing we had Thai pancakes for company (under shelter).

The main drawcard for me was the promise of seeing bioluminescent phytoplankton (Jase thought I was weird for wanting to see "shiny bacteria"!!). We had a wonderful afternoon/evening sailing around. We had a pretty multicultural boat - people from Germany, Aussie, Brazil, India... I learnt several new things and was surprised at just how easy it is to float in the middle of the ocean.

I was a bit afraid of the jellyfish, sea lice etc (which feel like prickles) but luckily that didn't put me off completely. Jase was brave enough to jump off the boat from its roof. We did some paddle boarding at one of the stops. I got some golden footage of Jase falling into the water.

He used some rubbing alcohol to avoid infection.

He did some rock climbing and then back flipped into the water. We had a lovely buffet dinner on the boat while the sun set. We also had a bit of a swim.

When you moved your hands under the water you could see the bioluminescent phytoplankton. They were like little bits of pixie dust. They weren't as blue as the pictures on the internet might make you to think, and you could only see them when underwater. It was an awesome experience. They also made noises, like rice bubbles when you pour milk over them, as you swam among them. Finally at around 8pm we were dropped back to shore.

We heard about the big earthquake in NZ while on board (weirdly good reception). We hope there's not too much damage and that you're not too shaken. Take care. <3 -Kimmie
