Early this morning we caught the ferry from Phuket to Ao Nang. The trip took a couple of hours, but it was pretty smooth sailing.

We were seated inside the hull of the ferry. Luckily it wasn't full, because if it was it would have been very hot and claustrophobic.

Luckily we don't have big bags! We eventually found a transfer bus to take us in to town.

Ao Nang is much more touristy than Phuket Town where we just were. In Ao Nang it does seem like the local council cares a bit more about the town as in they actually have an alright promenade which they seem to make an effort to keep clean, and decorate with street art. There seems to be a lot of development going on. There is a new building going up opposite our hotel which I find hilarious because if you look closely you'll notice that the walls are not quite straight! This seems to be a common theme with the construction here.

The good restaurants don't tend to need people outside to drum up business. Funny that.

[![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1679632248jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1679632248jpg.jpg) At either end of the beach there were a bunch of long boats waiting to take people over to the islands and other beaches. We will be catching one to Railay Beach tomorrow.

As you may have guessed, we saw a family of monkeys hiding up in the trees. In the afternoon we enjoyed happy hour cocktails by the pool, followed by a swim.
