_Sa-was-dee kap (hello)_ Last night we arrived at our little resort in Karon beach pretty tired and ready to sleep. I was quite relieved that we managed to reach our destination without any real issues (although it was not stress-free, e.g. figuring out the taxi system at Phuket airport). I get the feeling that a lot of the time in Thailand it's a case of "try and hope for the best". I'm sure we'll share many more examples of this. Our resort room is quite big, and rather cute. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1457943615jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1457943615jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1848634429jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1848634429jpg.jpg) It's not without safety concerns though. There are random floor lips everywhere (see above bathroom picture), the tiles are slippery, and the power sockets are like: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1727571106jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1727571106jpg.jpg) Yes, we are using that power socket to charge Jase's phone! I also just saw several rats scampering past our balcony. Some of the random stray cats lying next to the roads of Phuket obviously need to pay this place a visit! üêÅüêÄüêÅüêàüêàüêà As for today's adventures, this morning we went for a walk in search of breakfast and coffee. Magically, we found a little Italian place just down the road which even had freshly baked goods. Jase tried a "Thai coffee" which he found to be quite sweet. I had a nutella mocha (I am pretty sure my selection won üòâ).

After that pitstop we did a bit of shopping and looked around the beach area. Nice beach but the rubbish definitely tainted it. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-975723491jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-975723491jpg.jpg) It's an overcast and muggy day. We decided to hide from the weather and get our first massage ("foot spa"). There are many massage places around and they are all the same price, so really we just tried to find the least dodgy looking one. The one we chose was a good find, and they even added in a bit of arm and neck massage which was kind of them (although at the time I was concerned I may have miscommunicated!). [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1244763740jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1244763740jpg.jpg) Check out the downpour that luckily occurred when we were inside! \[wpvideo uKpbfOD5\] Our lunch choice was random-we just hoped for the best. Luckily it was nice. Jase tried a filled pineapple dish, which was on his "to-do" list. It was pretty delicious. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-652413509jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-652413509jpg.jpg) They served us water with our meal but I am a bit scared of drinking non-sealed water, and therefore had some of Jase's beer instead (eww beer!) We didn't realise the portions would be so big! Yay for doggy bags and cheap dinners. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-272821131jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-272821131jpg.jpg) We enjoyed watching the dinosaur-like birds, which the restaurant waiter threw raw rice to.

Check out some of these curious finds: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1592625542jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1592625542jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1778445351jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1778445351jpg.jpg) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1404583943jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1404583943jpg.jpg) (Note this 'essence of chicken' was is the drink section!) [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1114150211jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-1114150211jpg.jpg) Jase was thinking of buying the above jelly drink to try it out, but I didn't think I could stomach it... Thailand has so many weird and wonderful things. Below you see a man selling brooms as he bikes next to the road. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-504896260jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-504896260jpg.jpg)Here's some gasoline being sold in bottles on the side of the road: [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-261117395jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-261117395jpg.jpg) We were not a fan of the annoying guy who came up to us on his bike and tried to sell us a timeshare. He sounded like a normal tourist at first, but when he asked if we were over 30 we knew we should just walk away (which we did!). Thailand is home to many orchids. If only they were so cheap back home, then I'd buy so many to decorate with. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-591115943jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-591115943jpg.jpg) Right now, I am enjoying the 90's pop music playing beside the pool. Some old boyband classics (e.g. Uptown Girl) and a poolside bar entice us to try out the pool. [![](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-163114636jpg.jpg)](http://jovialdragon.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wp-image-163114636jpg.jpg) Our first day has been nice and relaxing. Just what we needed. See you later! Kimmie **_Postscript_**\- the pool is really refreshing and I also love the bath. ¬†üê¨ We also saw what looked like flares rising slowly across the sky tonight. Hopefully someone isn't in trouble...
