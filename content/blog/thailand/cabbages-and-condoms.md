This morning we headed off to Lumphini Park, one of the larger parks in Bangkok.

The lizards crawl about like mini dinosaurs and have snake-like tongues.

Fortunately, it was in English and just had Thai subtitles. The tickets to see the film were pretty cheap (about $4 NZD), so we picked up some popcorn too. They had a few interesting flavours. We tried corn cheese flavour which was pretty good.

This restaurant is run by a NGO created to raise money to educate people about family planning around Thailand. They had a lot of posters about and statues made of condoms. Even the lampshades were made out of condoms.
