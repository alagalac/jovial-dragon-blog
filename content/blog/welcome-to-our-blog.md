Hello everyone, and welcome! You know, we had a hard time thinking of a name for our blog. We went through all sorts of weird names: chocolatesushi, sushimagic, mangosushi.... (Jase has sushi on the brain) Then Jase decided that we should combine two words that start with the first letter of our names. He came up with jovial. I could not think of a cool k word. I do like dragons though.  ...and that is how jovialdragon was born. The purpose of our blog is to share our adventures with you. After work on Wednesday the 2nd of September 2015 we leave for Auckland. We're staying there the night and then catching an early flight to Japan on the 3rd. We've been thinking about, and planning, this trip for quite some time. We're hoping to blog most, if not every, day while we are away. We look forward to sharing with you. Arigatou ~jovialdragon~
